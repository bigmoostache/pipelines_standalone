### Hip Joint

The hip joint is a large, weight-bearing synovial joint of the ball-and-socket type, formed by the articulation between the head of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis (Figure 1). This configuration allows for a wide range of motion—including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and internal and external rotation—while providing the stability necessary to support the weight of the body during both static and dynamic activities.

The acetabulum is a deep, cup-shaped socket that is further deepened by the acetabular labrum, a ring of fibrocartilage attached to its rim. The labrum enhances the stability of the joint by increasing the depth of the acetabulum and providing a sealing effect, which helps maintain negative intra-articular pressure. Injuries to the labrum, such as tears, can lead to symptoms including pain, weakness, clicking, and a sensation of instability in the hip joint.

Several structures contribute to the stability and function of the hip joint:

- **Bony Architecture**: The congruency of the femoral head and the acetabulum provides inherent stability.
- **Acetabular Labrum**: Deepens the socket and improves joint stability.
- **Joint Capsule and Ligaments**: The joint capsule is reinforced by strong ligaments, including the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments, which limit excessive movements and maintain joint integrity.
- **Surrounding Musculature**: Muscles around the hip joint, such as the gluteus medius and minimus (abductors) and the external rotators (piriformis, obturator internus and externus, superior and inferior gemelli), play a crucial role in stabilizing the joint during movement.

In addition to providing stability, the hip joint is essential for locomotion and the performance of daily activities. Its design balances the need for mobility and strength, enabling humans to walk, run, and change direction efficiently.
