      "html_content": "<h1><h3>Background and Rationale</h3></h1>\n<!--\nExpectations in substance and form - Provides an overview of the emergence and rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, highlighting their growing impact on scientific writing and contextualizing their significance in Orthopaedic research.\n-->\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><reference refid=\"6659\"></reference>The rapid evolu<reference refid=\"5970\"></reference>tion of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, has significantly impacted various fields, including scientific writing in Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology research. LLMs, which rely on vast amounts of textual data to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, have been increasingly integrated into scientific writing processes <reference refid=\"4310\"></reference>. The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) highlights this growing impact, revealing a notable increase in AI-generated content in articles submitted to the Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research journal, with suspected AI usage rising from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023 <reference refid=\"6718\"></reference>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://lucario.deepdocs.net/files?file=2cfe2776-feb1-41bf-bd06-f57d94b388af_20250315015714.png\" style=\"width: 245px; height: auto; cursor: pointer;\" draggable=\"true\">\n<p><reference refid=\"4009\"></reference></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Historically, artificial intelligence has been employed in scientific writing to enhance productivity and streamline research processes, particularly in fields like clinical decision support, medical imaging analysis, and drug development <reference refid=\"9165\"></reference>. The introduction of LLMs, however, <reference refid=\"8449\"></reference> has added a new dimension to this landscape. These models, trained on vast corpora of text, can generate new content by mimicking patterns and structures from their training data <reference refid=\"1880\"></reference>. This capability raises questions about the originality of AI-generated text and its potential to blur the lines between paraphrasing and plagiarism <reference refid=\"7877\"></reference>. The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) identifies the year of submission and geographic origin as significant risk factors for higher AI usage, with Asian authors and 2023 entries showing a higher prevalence of AI-generated content <reference refid=\"6718\"></reference>. Specifically, articles from Asia had a higher proportion of suspected AI rates &gt;20% compared to other regions, with an odds ratio of 1.79 [95% CI: 1.03\u2013<reference refid=\"9528\"></reference>3.11] .</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><reference refid=\"1129\"></reference>While LLMs <reference refid=\"1140\"></reference>have the potential to enhance research productivity by accelerating manuscript preparation and assisting in writing, they also pose ethical challenges, particularly regarding authorship and the originality of scientific content <reference refid=\"9962\"></reference>. The stu<reference refid=\"1515\"></reference>dy emphasizes the importance of developing guidelines for AI-assisted writing to address these issues, including proper attribution to AI tools and defining the contributions of human researchers . As Gilat and Cole (2023) discuss, the future of scientific writing, reviewing, and editing will be significantly influenced by AI, necessitating a reevaluation of authorship norms and ethical considerations .</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) serves as a call to action for stakehol<reference refid=\"9321\"></reference>ders to establish transparent disclosure practices and develop robust guidelines for the responsible integration of LLMs in scientific writing . As the field of Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology continues to evolve, understanding the role of AI in scientific writing will be crucial for maintaining the integrity of research. The study also highlights the limitations of current AI detection tools, such as ZeroGPT, which provide only an estimated AI usage rate and may have a margin of error . This underscores the need for more precise tools to detect AI use in writing and to establish clear guidelines for AI-assisted writing <reference refid=\"9962\"></reference>. As Weaver and McAlister (2023) suggest, LLMs could be seen as \"the emperor's new clothes,\" raising questions about the originality and authenticity of AI-generated content in scientific writing .</p>"

      "title": "Objectives and Scope of LLM Impact on Orthopaedic Research",
      "html_content": "<p>The rapid development and adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has influenced scientific writing practices in Orthopaedics and Traumatology. This section outlines the objectives of the review by examining how LLMs affect scientific originality, authorship norms, and the effectiveness of AI detection methods, while also addressing ethical considerations and suggesting directions for future research and policy formulation.</p>\n\n<h4>Examination of Scientific Originality</h4>\n<p>The integration of LLMs into scientific writing has been associated with an increase in AI-generated content. A retrospective study by Maroteau et al. (2023) observed an increase in AI usage from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023 <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference>. This finding indicates that text generated by LLMs may overlap with existing literature, which could limit diversity in scientific expression. Additionally, the study by Macken et al. <reference refid=\"7445\"></reference> reported similar clinical, radiographic, and patient\u2010reported outcomes between BIO-RSA and RSA with a 42-mm glenoid component, suggesting that increased LLM use might contribute to more uniform scientific reporting. <mention time=\"Today at 11:27 PM\" author=\"Guillaume Draznieks\">@ hello</mention></p>\n\n<h4>Authorship Norms and Ethical Implications</h4>\n<p>The use of AI in scientific writing raises important issues regarding authorship attribution. Maroteau et al. stress the need for clear guidelines to properly credit contributions made by AI tools like ChatGPT <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference>. The observed rise in AI-generated content\u2014from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023, particularly among submissions from Asian authors <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>\u2014underscores the importance of establishing objective policies that delineate the roles of human and machine contributions.</p>\n\n<h4>Assessing AI Detection Tools</h4>\n<p>The increasing reliance on LLMs has highlighted the need for effective AI detection mechanisms. In the study by Maroteau et al., the ZeroGPT tool was used to analyze 390 articles, revealing a higher rate of AI-generated content in 2023 compared to 2022 <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>. Macken et al. <reference refid=\"4828\"></reference> also emphasize the importance of statistical rigor in assessing the performance and reliability of these detection tools.</p>\n\n<h4>Focus on Orthopaedics and Traumatology Research</h4>\n<p>Research specific to orthopaedic applications has been conducted by Macken et al. <reference refid=\"7445\"></reference> and Merolla et al. <reference refid=\"3792\"></reference>. These studies examine surgical techniques, including biologic increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty (BIO-RSA) and metal-augmented baseplates (MIO-RSA), for treating shoulder osteoarthritis with multiplanar glenoid deformities. Both techniques demonstrated stable initial fixation and similar clinical outcomes, although concerns regarding the long-term viability of bone grafts in BIO-RSA patients were noted <reference refid=\"3792\"></reference>.</p>\n\n<h4>Ethical Implications and Recommendations</h4>\n<p>The ethical challenges associated with AI-generated content call for standardized guidelines that ensure transparent disclosure and proper attribution of AI contributions. Maroteau et al. <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference> advocate for policies that consider factors such as submission year and geographic origin to guide responsible use of LLMs in scientific writing.</p>\n\n<h4>Future Research Directions</h4>\n<p>Future investigations should focus on improving the accuracy and reliability of AI detection tools, as suggested by Maroteau et al. <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference> and supported by findings from Merolla et al. <reference refid=\"7884\"></reference>. Additional long-term studies are recommended to evaluate the impact of LLM integration on both scientific reporting and clinical outcomes in orthopaedic research.</p>"

The inclusion criteria were meticulously designed to capture empirical studies and theoretical analyses published in peer-reviewed journals between 2022 and 2023. By restricting the review to this period, we ensure that the selected studies reflect recent trends and developments in the use of LLMs within the specialized field of Orthopaedics.</p>\n<p>The selection process was executed by employing a comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases, including PubMed and Scopus. The strategy involved the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Keyword Optimization:</strong> Keywords such as \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d \u201cChatGPT,\u201d \u201cLLM,\u201d \u201corthopaedics,\u201d \u201cauthorship,\u201d and \u201cplagiarism\u201d were combined using Boolean operators to ensure a targeted retrieval of relevant studies.</li>\n  <li><strong>Database Filtering:</strong> The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles and reviews in English, ensuring consistency and high quality of the selected literature.</li>\n  <li><strong>Time Frame Specification:</strong> Only studies published between 2022 and 2023 were considered, capturing the most recent insights into LLM applications in scientific writing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After identifying potential studies, the next phase involved a rigorous screening process where exclusion criteria were applied. Studies that did not focus on Orthopaedic research, lacked relevance to the key themes, or were not peer-reviewed were systematically excluded. For instance, methodological frameworks from clinical studies, as referenced in <reference refid=\"5175\"></reference>, were adapted to refine our inclusion criteria.</p>\n<p>Data extraction was accomplished using standardized forms designed to consistently capture information across all included studies. Key data points extracted included:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Publication details (e.g., journal name, year of publication, authorship)</li>\n  <li>Study design and methodological quality</li>\n  <li>Key themes related to originality, ethical considerations, and authorship policies</li>\n  <li>The reported efficacy and limitations of AI detection tools, such as ZeroGPT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The extraction process also involved cross-referencing by multiple independent reviewers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussions with senior authors, echoing the rigorous verification processes described in References 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, insights from related studies, such as the advanced imaging techniques described by Merolla et al. (2023), were incorporated to enhance our understanding of methodological rigor in data extraction. This multi-faceted approach not only reinforces the validity of our review but also provides a robust framework for future research exploring the intersection of LLMs and scientific writing.</p>\n<p>Overall, the combination of a detailed search strategy, stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a comprehensive data extraction protocol ensures the reliability of our findings. By integrating these systematic methods and cross-referencing with established literature, this review provides a thorough analysis of the impact of LLMs on scientific writing in Orthopaedics.</p>"
