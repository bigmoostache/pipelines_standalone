AB  - Each year, there are more than eight million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.3 
      million deaths. There is a renewed interest in extrapulmonary forms of 
      tuberculosis as its relative frequency increases. Among extrapulmonary organs, 
      pleura and lymph nodes are the most common. Their diagnosis is often difficult 
      and is based on clinical, radiological, bacteriological and histological 
      findings. Extrapulmonary lesions are paucibacillary and samplings, in most cases, 
      difficult to obtain, so diagnosis is often simply presumptive. Nucleic acid 
      amplification tests, which are fast and specific, have greatly facilitated the 
      diagnosis of some forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, their 
      sensitivity is poor and a negative test does not eliminate the diagnosis. 
      Treatment is the same as for pulmonary forms, but its duration is nine to 12 
      months for central nervous system and for bone tuberculosis. Corticosteroids are 
      indicated in meningeal and pericardial localizations. Complementary surgery is 
      used for certain complicated forms.

AB  - The evolution between Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and active 
      tuberculosis is multifactorial and involves different biological scales. The 
      synthesis of ESAT-6 or the induction of alveolar macrophage necrosis are key, but 
      to understand it, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of endogenous and 
      exogenous reinfection, drainage of lung parenchyma and respiratory mechanics, 
      local fibrosis processes and blood supply. Paradoxically, the immune response 
      generated by the infection is highly protective (90%) against active 
      tuberculosis, although as it is essentially based on the proliferation of Th1 
      lymphocytes, it cannot prevent reinfection. Severe immunosuppression can only 
      explain 10% of active tuberculosis cases, while the remainder are attributable to 
      comorbidities, a proinflammatory environment and an unknown genetic propensity. 
      The pathogenic capacity of environmental mycobacteria is discrete, linked to 
      deficits in the innate and acquired immune response. The ability to generate 
      biofilms and the ability of M. ulcerans to generate the exotoxin mycolactone is 
      remarkable.

AB  - Despite concerted efforts over the past 2 decades at developing new diagnostics, 
      drugs, and vaccines with expanding pipelines, tuberculosis remains a global 
      emergency. Several novel diagnostic technologies show promise of better 
      point-of-care rapid tests for tuberculosis including nucleic acid-based 
      amplification tests, imaging, and breath analysis of volatile organic compounds. 
      Advances in new and repurposed drugs for use in multidrug-resistant (MDR) or 
      extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis have focused on development of 
      several new drug regimens and their evaluation in clinical trials and now 
      influence World Health Organization guidelines. Since the failure of the MVA85A 
      vaccine 2 years ago, there have been no new tuberculosis vaccine candidates 
      entering clinical testing. The current status quo of the lengthy treatment 
      duration and poor treatment outcomes associated with MDR/XDR tuberculosis and 
      with comorbidity of tuberculosis with human immunodeficiency virus and 
      noncommunicable diseases is unacceptable. New innovations and political and 
      funder commitment for early rapid diagnosis, shortening duration of therapy, 
      improving treatment outcomes, and prevention are urgently required.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) has affected humanity since the beginning of the recorded time 
      and is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, and 
      immunosuppression. Since Koch discovered the infectious nature of the disease in 
      1882, knowledge about its history and physiopathology has advanced, but it 
      continues to be a global public health problem. More than 9 million new cases 
      occurred in 2008 worldwide (with an incidence of 139/100,000 inhabitants), of 
      whom more than one million died. Over half million of the cases presented with 
      multidrug resistant-TB. Africa represents the continent with the highest 
      incidence and the most HIV co-infection. The situation in Eastern Europe is also 
      worrisome because of the high incidence and frequency drug resistance. In 
      developed countries, TB has been localized in more vulnerable populations, such 
      as immigrants and persons with social contention. There is an increase of 
      extra-pulmonary presentation in this context, related to non-European ethnicity, 
      HIV infection, and younger age. In Spain, the increasing immigrant population has 
      presented a need to improve coordination between territories and strengthen 
      surveillance The global control plan is based on the DOTS strategy, although the 
      objectives and activities were redefined in 2006 to incorporate the measurement 
      of global development, and community and healthcare strengthening. Adequate 
      control measures in a more local context and continual activity evaluation are 
      necessary to decrease the burden of suffering and economic loss that causes this 
      ancient disease.

AB  - At present, 8-10 million new cases of tuberculosis and 3 million tuberculosis 
      related deaths occur worldwide. Approximately 90% of patients and deaths occur in 
      the developing countries. In Hungary, 2024 new cases with tuberculosis were 
      detected in 2005. This incidence corresponds to the epidemiological data of 
      western European countries. However, the multidrug and extensively drug resistant 
      bacteria challenged the otherwise effective antimicrobial therapy. In Hungary, 27 
      new multidrug-, and 3 new extensively drug resistant tuberculoses were detected 
      in 2005. The recommendation of the World Health Organisation and the renewed 
      guideline of the Hungarian Board of Pulmonology include all criteria necessary to 
      the effective prevention, diagnosis and therapy of multidrug-, and extensively 
      drug resistant tuberculoses.

AB  - The quality of diagnosis and therapeutic management affects the frequency of 
      multiresistant tuberculosis observed in a given country. In 1991, physicians in 
      the United States were faced with a large number of cases of multiresistant 
      tuberculosis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, leading to 
      international public health measures designed to prevent the development of 
      resistant strains. At the present time there are only a limited number of 
      resistant strains in France. Continuous surveillance of multiresistant strains by 
      the 33 University Hospitals in Paris and 300 bacteriology laboratories throughout 
      France has shown that the rate of multiresistance is 0.7%. Six of the 8 cases of 
      primary resistance observed in Paris from 1992 to 1994 were associated with human 
      immunodeficiency virus infection. Approximately half of the cases with secondary 
      multiresistance occurred in subjects born outside France. Patients with 
      multiresistant tuberculosis must be placed in strict isolation and given 
      long-term treatment combining antibiotics and toxic products requiring careful 
      handling in a specialized unit.

AB  - Looking at the chapter on "natural history" in any tuberculosis (TB) reference 
      book, there is a kind of certainty regarding TB in adults. That is the concept of 
      "post-primary" TB described as the reactivation of dormant bacilli hidden in an 
      old lesion developed during infancy due to a type of local immunosuppression. 
      Intriguingly, this concept involves at least two major uncertainties: how can 
      dormant bacilli remain for such a long period, almost a lifetime, in an old 
      lesion, taking into account granuloma dynamism; and what sort of local 
      immunosuppression is the one that facilitates reactivation? The controversy 
      between reactivation and exogenous reinfection as the cause of active TB started 
      very soon in TB research. Interestingly, this "balance" was disturbed in the 
      1960s when the "Unitary Concept" became very successful in supporting the 
      reactivation dogma. The "Unitary Concept" was mainly based on the data of 
      tuberculin surveillance during the pre-antibiotic era as well as the data 
      obtained from experimental modelling in animals. At the same time, the 
      "Three-risks model" appeared to explain the relationship between the risk of 
      infection and TB incidence, granting reinfection a key role in adult TB together 
      with primary infection. This role was reinforced by the studies of recurrence 
      based on molecular epidemiology, and a better knowledge of the immune response, 
      granuloma dynamics, and lung physiology. Now it is a matter of taking it into 
      account when designing new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies and also 
      reflecting it in text books to better illustrate to our students.

AB  - This article analyzes the concept of inactive fibrotic lesions of presumed 
      tuberculous origin (old healed tuberculosis), defined by radiological 
      characteristics and a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), and we examine the 
      evidence-based foundation for the indication of treatment of latent tuberculosis 
      infection in these cases. We explore the risk of reactivation in older and recent 
      literature, and the problems raised by the differential diagnosis with active 
      tuberculosis with negative bacteriology. We also analyze data on the prevalence 
      of fibrotic lesions in the recent literature. We examine the possible role of 
      Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) versus TST and other molecular antigen 
      detection techniques in sputum that can aid in establishing the diagnosis and we 
      discuss the current indications for chemoprophylaxis and the different options 
      available. We propose diagnostic guidelines and therapeutic algorithms based on 
      risk stratification by age and other factors in the management of radiological 
      lesions that raise a differential diagnosis between fibrotic lesions and active 
      pulmonary tuberculosis with negative bacteriology.

TI  - On the nature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-latent bacilli.
PG  - 1044-51
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis-latent bacilli are microorganisms that adapt to 
      stressful conditions generated by the infected host against them. By slowing 
      metabolism or becoming dormant, they may counterbalance these conditions and 
      appear as silent to the immune system. Moreover, the dynamic turnover of the 
      infected cells provokes a constant reactivation of the latent bacilli when the 
      environmental conditions are favourable, or an activation after being dormant in 
      necrotic and fibrotic lesions for a long period of time. Since there is no in 
      vivo nor in vitro evidence for quick resuscitation of dormant bacilli, the 
      current authors strongly favour the possibility that latent tuberculosis 
      infection can be maintained for no longer than approximately 10 yrs, which is, 
      nowadays, a time period very close to that considered for "primary" tuberculosis. 
      This concept may also be helpful for newer epidemiological considerations 
      regarding the real impact of reinfection in tuberculosis.
