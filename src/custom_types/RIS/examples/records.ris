N2  - Rotator cuff tears are the most common upper extremity condition seen by primary care and orthopaedic surgeons, with a spectrum ranging from tendinopathy to full-thickness tears with arthritic change. Some tears are traumatic, but most rotator cuff problems are degenerative. Not all tears are symptomatic and not all progress, and many patients in whom tears become more extensive do not experience symptom worsening. Hence, a standard algorithm for managing patients is challenging. The pathophysiology of rotator cuff tears is complex and encompasses an interplay between the tendon, bone and muscle. Rotator cuff tears begin as degenerative changes within the tendon, with matrix disorganization and inflammatory changes. Subsequently, tears progress to partial-thickness and then full-thickness tears. Muscle quality, as evidenced by the overall size of the muscle and intramuscular fatty infiltration, also influences symptoms, tear progression and the outcomes of surgery. Treatment depends primarily on symptoms, with non-operative management sufficient for most patients with rotator cuff problems. Modern arthroscopic repair techniques have improved recovery, but outcomes are still limited by a lack of understanding of how to improve tendon to bone healing in many patients.

N2  - Objective: Osteoarthritis affects over 5.4 million people in the United States. A common treatment is to perform intra-articular corticosteroid injections. However, the ideal steroid dose is unknown. This study aimed to pilot a corticosteroid injection protocol for primary glenohumeral OA. Methods: We conducted a double blinded randomized feasibility pilot study. Patients with primary osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint were recruited and randomized to receive 20 ​mg, 40 ​mg, or 80 ​mg of triamcinolone. The primary outcome was the feasibility of the protocol and change in the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) 6 months following injection. Results: 300 patients were screened for participation with 78 meeting inclusion criteria. 19 subjects completed the study. The most common reason for not participating was concern they would receive a smaller dose than previous injections. There was a 26% dropout rate, with 2 patients undergoing a total shoulder arthroplasty. There was no clinically significant difference (p ​= ​0.090) between the groups at 6-months for the SPADI although all treatment groups showed a reduction of SPADI from baseline at 6 months. There was one adverse event in the 20 ​mg group, with a patient experiencing facial flushing after the injection. Conclusion: We were successful in developing a feasible protocol. In the future excluding those who have received previous injections would be helpful for a higher enrollment rate. This patient concern highlights the need to complete clinical trials to guide medical decisions surrounding corticosteroid administration. NCT03586687.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections (CSI) are commonly used for the treatment of shoulder pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rotator cuff arthropathy (RCA). These injections may increase the risk of infection following eventual shoulder arthroplasty. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data to explore the relationship between preoperative CSI's and postoperative periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through September 29, 2023. Of the 4,221 retrieved, 7 studies including 136,233 patients were included for qualitative analysis. Studies describing patients receiving CSI prior to shoulder arthroplasty and the effect on postoperative infection risk were included in the systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis. Assessment of risk of bias was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. RESULTS: Receiving a corticosteroid injection prior to shoulder arthroplasty was found to have a statistically significant association with increased risk for PJI (OR: 1.13. 95%; CI: 1.06-1.19; p < 0.0001). The rate of PJI increased when injections were given closer to the time of surgery. Patients who received an injection at any time point before surgery had a 5.4% risk of PJI compared to 7.9% and 9.0% in patients receiving an injection within 3 months and 1 month of surgery respectively. This time dependent association however did not reach statistical significance: 1 month OR 1.48; 95% Cl: 0.86-2.53; p = 0.16, 3 months OR 1.95; 95% Cl: 0.95-4.00; p = 0.07. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that patients receiving corticosteroid shoulder injections prior to shoulder arthroplasty may be at an increased risk for prosthetic joint infection postoperatively. While time dependent stratification did not reach statistical significance, our findings indicate a clear trend of increased risk for patients receiving injections closer to surgery.

N2  - Introduction: Optimal pain control methods after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) achieve reduced opioid consumption, shortened hospital stay, and improved patient satisfaction in addition to adequate analgesia. Interscalene brachial plexus block is the gold standard for TSA, yet it typically does not provide pain relief lasting beyond 24 hours. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) purportedly provides prolonged analgesia, yet it has been minimally explored for interscalene block, and it is significantly more expensive than standard bupivacaine. Methods: This is a prospective, 2-arm, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Subjects presenting for anatomic or reverse TSA were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive interscalene brachial plexus block with either LB plus bupivacaine (LBB group) or bupivacaine plus dexamethasone and epinephrine (BDE group). The primary outcome was 120-hour postoperative opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes were pain scores up to 96 hours postoperatively, pain control satisfaction, complications, level of distress from block numbness, and hospital stay. Results: Ninety patients, 45 per group, were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and randomized. Because of withdrawal of consent and loss to follow-up, 40 in each group completed enrollment through postoperative day 60. Total 120-hour postoperative opioid consumption was similar between groups (P = .127), with no differences within 24- or 48-hour time intervals. Postoperative pain scores at 24-48 hours, 48-72 hours, 72-96 hours, and day 60 were significantly lower for the LBB group. Discussion: LB interscalene brachial plexus block before total shoulder arthroplasty did not reduce 120-hour postoperative opioid consumption but significantly reduced postoperative pain between 24 and 96 hours and at postoperative day 60.

N2  - The beach chair position (BCP) is widely used in shoulder surgery; however, it frequently leads to hypotension. Hypotension in BCP is prevalent among older patients who are at risk of secondary complications such as ischemic injuries. Therefore, this prospective study aimed to investigate the association and predictive value of frailty, as assessed by ultrasound-measured quadriceps depth and questionnaire, in patients aged ≥65 years undergoing elective shoulder surgery under general anesthesia. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for hypotension in BCP under general anesthesia. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to assess the predictive values of various parameters. The results indicated that a quadriceps depth < 2.3 cm and BCP for an extended period significantly increased the risk of hypotension. The combined consideration of quadriceps depth < 2.3 cm and frailty demonstrated markedly superior predictive power compared with each factor individually. In conclusion, the study findings facilitate the screening and identification of risk factors for older patients undergoing surgery in BCP, thereby enhancing perioperative management.

N2  - Background: Steroid injections are a well-known first-line treatment for glenohumeral osteoarthritis; however, many patients eventually require definitive management with surgery. Recent literature has called into question the safety of steroid injections before shoulder surgery due to increased infections and revisions. Conclusive data regarding the relationship between preoperative injection and postoperative outcomes is lacking. This study aimed to determine the impact of ipsilateral injections on clinical outcomes following shoulder arthroplasty (SA). Methods: A retrospective study was performed on patients who underwent SA by a single fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon from 2017 to 2021. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on preoperative corticosteroid injection: (1) injection group (IG) and (2) no injection (control group (CG)). The IG was further stratified based on number of injections (1 vs. ≥2 injections) and timing of injections relative to surgery (<3 months, 3-12 months, and >12 months). Patient-reported pain and satisfaction, simple shoulder test, shoulder pain and disability index, visual analog scale for pain, University of California-Los Angeles score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant-Murley score, range of motion, complications, and reoperations were collected preoperatively and at final follow-up. Comparisons were made between groups and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) were calculated for each score. Results: 421 patients (IG = 98 patients, CG = 323 patients) were included, with mean follow-up of 22 months. The IG had more females (69.1% vs. 48.9%; P < .001) and older age (75 vs. 70; P < .001). There was significantly greater preoperative range of motion in the IG for forward elevation (80° vs. 70°; P = .025) and abduction (70° vs. 60°; P = .004). At final follow-up, all groups had a high percentage (mean 80.26%) of patients exceeding both MCID and SCB for all measures. More patients in the IG exceeded MCID and SCB for visual analog scale for pain (P = .009 and P = .007, respectively), and MCID for American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (P = .046) compared to the CG. The group with ≥2 injections reported worse shoulder pain and disability index scores (P = .024). Complication and reoperation rates were comparable between groups. Conclusion: Our study indicates that a single ipsilateral shoulder injection did not worsen postoperative outcomes or complication rates following SA. However, patients who received two or more injections had inferior patient-reported outcomes. Surgeons can continue to use injections as a viable first-line management option before shoulder arthroplasty for reliable pain relief without concerns for increased complications.

N2  - Background: The use of total shoulder arthroplasty is continuing to rise with its expanding indications. For patients with chronic conditions, such as glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff arthropathy, nonoperative treatment is typically done prior to arthroplasty and often includes corticosteroid injections (CSIs). Recent studies in the shoulder arthroplasty literature as well as applied from the hip and knee literature have focused on the risk of periprosthetic infection. Literature is lacking as to whether the judicious use of corticosteroids in the year prior to arthroplasty influences patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The purpose of this study was to determine if preoperative CSIs prior to shoulder arthroplasty affected 2-year PROs. Methods: Retrospective review of anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) patients (n = 230) was performed at a single institution including multiple surgeons. Patients were included if they had preoperative and a minimum of 2-year postoperative PROs, including: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), visual analog scale, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Veteran's RAND 12 Physical Component Score, and Veteran's RAND 12 Mental Component Score. Patients were included in the injection group if they had received an injection, either glenohumeral or subacromial, within 12 months prior to arthroplasty (inject = 134). Subgroup analysis included anatomic (total shoulder arthroplasty [TSA] = 92) and RSA (RSA = 138) as well as those with no injection within 12 months prior to surgery. An analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes between patients who received an injection and those who did not prior to TSA and RSA. Results: There were 230 patients included with 134 patients in the injection group and 96 in the no injection group. Patients who received an injection in the year prior to arthroplasty displayed a significantly higher ASES (82 [16.23 standard deviation] vs. 76 [19.43 standard deviation], P < .01) and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (70 [24.49 standard deviation] vs. 63 [29.22 standard deviation], P < .01) scores vs. those who had not received injection. There was no difference when comparing preoperative injection vs. no injection in patients undergoing TSA. Those patients undergoing RSA displayed significantly higher ASES scores (P < .01). There were no significant differences in visual analog scale, Veteran's RAND 12 Physical Component Score, and Veteran's RAND 12 Mental Component Score among any analysis (P > .05), and the minimal clinically important difference in ASES was not different between groups (P.09). Conclusion: CSIs within 12 months prior to anatomic and RSA do not compromise PROs during a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Although more complications occurred in the injection group, it did not reach statistical significance and warrants further study in a larger population.

N2  - Introduction Previous trials favored a continuous interscalene brachial plexus block over a single injection for major shoulder surgery. However, these trials did not administer a multimodal analgesic regimen. This randomized, controlled unblinded trial tested the hypothesis that a continuous infusion of local anesthetic for an interscalene brachial plexus block still provides superior analgesia after major shoulder surgery when compared with a single injection in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. Methods Sixty patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomized to receive a bolus of ropivacaine 0.5%, 20 mL, with or without a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% 4–8 mL/hour, for an interscalene brachial plexus block. Patients were provided with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and on movement, and functional outcomes, measured over 48 hours after surgery. Results Median (IQR) cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24 hours postoperatively was 10 mg (4–24) in the continuous infusion group and 14 mg (8–26) in the single injection group (p=0.74). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the secondary outcomes. Conclusions A continuous infusion of local anesthetic for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide superior analgesia after major shoulder surgery when compared with a single injection in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. The findings of this study are limited by performance and detection biases. Trial registration number NCT04394130.

N2  - Background: Perioperative corticosteroids have shown potential as nonopioid analgesic adjuncts for various orthopedic pathologies, but there is a lack of research on their use in the postoperative setting after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a methylprednisolone taper on a multimodal pain regimen after TSA. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03661645) of opioid-naive patients undergoing TSA. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intraoperative dexamethasone only (control group) or intraoperative dexamethasone followed by a 6-day oral methylprednisolone (Medrol) taper course (treatment group). All patients received the same standardized perioperative pain management protocol. Standardized pain journal entries were used to record visual analog pain scores (VAS-pain), VAS-nausea scores, and quantity of opioid tablet consumption during the first 7 postoperative days (POD). Patients were followed for at least one year postoperatively for clinical evaluation, collection of patient-reported outcomes, and observation of complications. Results: A total of 67 patients were enrolled in the study; 32 in the control group and 35 in the treatment group. The groups had similar demographics and comorbidities. The treatment group demonstrated a reduction in mean VAS pain scores over the first 7 POD. Between POD 1 and POD 7, patients in the control group consumed an average of 17.6 oxycodone tablets while those in the treatment group consumed an average of 5.5 tablets. This equated to oral morphine equivalents of 132.1 and 41.1 for the control and treatment groups, respectively. There were fewer opioid-related side effects during the first postoperative week in the treatment group. The treatment group reported improved VAS pain scores at 2-week, 6-week, and 12-week postoperatively. There were no differences in Europe Quality of Life, shoulder subjective value (SSV), at any time point between groups, although American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire scores showed a slight improvement at 6-weeks in the treatment group. At mean follow-up, (control group: 23.4 months; treatment group:19.4 months), there was 1 infection in the control group and 1 postoperative cubital tunnel syndrome in the treatment group. No other complications were reported. Conclusions: A methylprednisolone taper course shows promise in reducing acute pain and opioid consumption as part of a multimodal regimen following TSA. As a result of this study, we have included this 6-day methylprednisolone taper course in our multimodal regimen for all primary shoulder arthroplasties. We hope this trial serves as a foundation for future studies on the use of low-dose oral corticosteroids and other nonnarcotic modalities to control pain after shoulder surgeries.

N2  - Research Objectives: To describe outcomes of a patient treated with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) for persistent pain following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA). Design: Observational Case Report: describing interventions performed clinically for one patient. Patient's shoulder arthroplasty surgery was on 10/19/21. PNS device implanted from 9/29/22 to 11/28/22, with follow-up until 5/8/23. Setting: Outpatient ambulatory care clinic at an academic medical center. Participants: The patient is a 64-year-old non-Hispanic white female. She worked as a Quality Control Manager before retiring at age 52. She initially presented to our institution in 2016 with right shoulder pain of insidious onset, originally diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon as calcific tendinitis, and underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression. In late 2021, she developed pain and weakness of insidious onset. MRI arthrogram confirmed supraspinatus and infraspinatus tear, and she underwent rTSA. Despite uncomplicated surgery, physical therapy for 9 months and trigger point injection, she experienced persistent pain and muscle hypertonicity of the trapezius and deltoid. Interventions: The SPRINT Peripheral Nerve Stimulator was implanted from 9/29/22 to 11/28/22, starting 11 months post-surgery. PNS device parameters included frequency of 12 Hz, duration of 12 hours/day, and an intensity adjusted to tolerance. The patient additionally underwent 4 physical therapy visits during the time of implant. Main Outcome Measures: Global Rating of Change, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Results: The SPADI is a 13-item questionnaire with a higher score indicative of greater pain and disability. A SPADI score of 35 is expected 12 months after rTSA. Our patient began at 35 during the start of PNS treatment and improved to 32 after 2 months of PNS treatment. She continued to improve and maintained at 23 both 3 and 6 months after explant. She reported a Global Rating of Change of +6, a Great Deal Better, 6 months following device explant. Conclusions: Our report describes a successful outcome of PNS treatment for persistent pain following rTSA, with improved SPADI score and GROC. Larger trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of the device. Author(s) Disclosures: No known disclosures.

N2  - Background: Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal disease in adults over the age of 65. The first line of treatment typically consists of nonsurgical modalities prior to consideration for definitive treatment with total shoulder arthroplasty. Within this systematic review, we aim to assess the value of conservative management of glenohumeral osteoarthritis by evaluating the quality of available research and the efficacy of nonoperative treatment on patient-reported pain scores and functional outcome measures. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in literature published between 2000 and 2022. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the electronic databases, PubMed, EBSCO Host, Medline, and Google Scholar were searched. Studies included in analysis consisted of patients receiving nonoperative management of glenohumeral joint arthritis without concomitant additional shoulder pathologies with a measured intervention and reported patient outcome measure. Two blinded reviewers screened and evaluated the data quality using the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies tool. Results: Nineteen studies were included consisting of 1879 patients with a median follow-up of 6 months. Eighteen studies included intra-articular injections including hyaluronic acid, corticosteroid, bone marrow aspirate, leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma, and autologous-conditioned serum injections. Each study reported symptomatic improvement following injection. Hyaluronic acid was the most commonly used (13 of 18 studies) agent with multiple studies demonstrating temporary improvement in pain and function. Four studies reported the outcomes of noninjectable modalities including physical therapy, bracing, and radiofrequency ablation. Two studies demonstrate that injections combined with physical therapy can lead to greater improvement in Constant score and range over motion for a greater period of time. Conclusion: Conservative treatment modalities can be effective in lowering pain scores and improving functional outcome scores in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The effect of each individual modality may be most effective when combined with other treatments. However, these benefits appear to be short-term. Additional studies are necessary to further determine the long-term efficacy and establish guidelines for the mainstay of first-line therapy in the management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a nonopioid multimodal pain protocol on the amount of opioids prescribed, pain level, and complications in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) compared to a standard opioid regimen. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 2 consecutive cohorts who underwent either primary anatomic or reverse TSA by a single surgeon. The opioid cohort included patients from 2016 to 2020 who received an intraoperative periarticular injection (Ropivacaine, Epinephrine, and Ketorolac cocktail) and were prescribed Oxycodone/Acetaminophen 5/325 mg on discharge. The nonopioid cohort included patients from 2020 to 2022, consisting of preoperative oral analgesics (Celecoxib, Pregabalin, and Tramadol); intraoperative intravenous Dexamethasone and Acetaminophen and periarticular injection; and postoperative oral Dexamethasone and oral analgesics (Pregabalin, Tizanidine, Magnesium, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen). The nonopioid cohort had the option to ask for an opioid prescription postoperatively if needed. Patient-reported outcomes collected included visual analog scale scores for pain and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System up to 1 year after surgery. Opioid consumption using Morphine Milligram Equivalents were compared up to 3 months postoperatively. Results: There were 232 patients in the opioid and 112 in the nonopioid cohorts, respectively. The nonopioid protocol had lower mean visual analog scale scores at preoperative (6.4 vs. 7.4, P < .05), 10-day (3.5 vs. 4.2, P < .05), and 6-week postoperative time points (2.1 vs. 2.8, P < .05), but no differences between the groups were noted 3 months postoperatively. No differences in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System–upper extremity, pain interference, or depression were found preoperatively and up to 1 year after surgery. Opioid consumption was lower in the nonopioid cohort at all time periods (P < .01). Patients in the nonopioid cohort had significantly lower Morphine Milligram Equivalents at discharge, 10-day, 6-week, and 90-day time periods (P < .01) when compared to the opioid cohort. When analyzing risk factors for continued opioid prescriptions for the whole cohort, preoperative opioid use within 90 days before surgery (relative risk 4.69 [95% confidence interval 3.18-6.91; P < .01) and current tobacco use (relative risk 2.61 [95% confidence interval 1.50-4.54]; P = .01) were associated with continued refills >30 days. Complications in the perioperative period and 90-day hospital readmissions were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: A nonopioid postoperative regimen for patients undergoing TSA significantly reduces opioid prescriptions with similar patient-reported outcomes, subjective pain scores, and without increased complication rates compared to an opioid-only regimen.

N2  - Purpose: To report on minimum 5-year outcomes following subacromial balloon spacer implantation (SBSI), in terms of survivorship, pain reduction, functional outcomes, complications, and reoperations. Methods: Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing SBSI between April 1, 2012, and June 30, 2016. Patients completed preoperative and postoperative follow-up for minimum 5 years on the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs): Constant-Murley Score (CMS), visual analog scale for pain (VAS), strength, and patient satisfaction. Reoperations and complications were recorded. Minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated and the proportion of patients achieving MDC for CMS and VAS were calculated. Results: During the study period, SBSI was performed in 36 patients. Three patients were deceased within 5 years. Of the remaining 33 patients, follow-up was available on 29 patients (80.6%). Mean age at the time of operation was 72.7 ± 4.5 years, and 69% of the patients were males. Mean follow-up time was 72.5 months. Significant improvements from preoperative to last follow-up were demonstrated in CMS (36.08 vs. 63.88; P < .001), VAS (6.72 vs. 1.68; P < .001), and strength (3.8 vs 5.87 kg; P < .001). These improvements were demonstrated at 3 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 60 months. Mean patient satisfaction at last follow-up was 8.72. The MDC for both CMS and VAS was achieved by 75.9% (22/29) of patients. Four patients underwent conversion to a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Complications included one patient with balloon dislocation and one patient with a secondary infection due to urinary tract infection. Conclusions: Pain reduction and functional improvements are sustained at minimum 5 years after SBSI in patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears. The 5-year conversion rate to an RTSA was 13.79%. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case-series.

N2  - Objective: To perform a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) covering the management of common shoulder disorders. Data Sources: A systematic search of CPGs on specific shoulder disorders was conducted up to August 2022 in relevant databases. Study Selection: Twenty-six CPGs on rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, RC tear, calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, glenohumeral (GH) instability, GH osteoarthritis, or acromioclavicular disorders published from January 2008 onward were screened and included. Data Extraction: CPGs methodological quality was assessed with the AGREE II checklist. All recommendations from CPGs were extracted and categorized by shoulder disorder and care components (evaluation, diagnostic imaging, medical, rehabilitation, and surgical treatments). After semantic analysis of the terminology, recommendations for each shoulder disorders were classified by 2 reviewers into “recommended,” “may be recommended,” or “not recommended.” Disagreements were resolved by discussion until reviewers reached consensus. Data Synthesis: Only 12 CPGs (46%) were of high quality with major limitations related to the applicability and editorial independence of the guidelines. The initial evaluation of shoulder pain should include patient's history, subjective evaluation focused on red flags, and clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually not recommended to manage early shoulder pain, and recommendations for X-rays are conflicting. Acetaminophen, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and rehabilitation including exercises were recommended or may be recommended to treat all shoulder pain disorders. Guidelines on surgical management recommendations differed; for example, 6 CPGs reported that acromioplasty was recommended or may be recommended in chronic RC tendinopathy, whereas 4 CPGs did not recommend it. Conclusions: Recommendations vary for diagnostic imaging, conservative vs surgical treatment to manage shoulder pain, although several care components are consensual. The development of evidence-based, rigorous CPGs with a valid methodology and transparent reporting is warranted to improve overall shoulder pain care.

N2  - Background: An acromial stress fracture (ASF) is an uncommon complication after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) that can have severe clinical consequences on shoulder function. Although patient-specific factors have been identified to influence the risk of ASF, it is unclear whether modifying these factors can minimize risk. Moreover, there is limited information on the treatment outcomes of these fractures. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine modifiable risk factors for ASFs and the complication and revision rates of conservatively and operatively managed ASFs. Methods: The PearlDiver database was queried to identify a cohort of patients who underwent RTSA with minimum 2-year follow-up. Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes were used to compare the demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and medication use of patients with and without ASFs. Surgical complication and revision rates were compared between operatively and conservatively treated fractures. Results: The overall incidence of ASFs was 1.4%. Patient-specific factors that were independently associated with the occurrence of an ASF included osteoporosis, rheumatologic disease, shoulder corticosteroid injection within 3 months before surgery, and chronic oral corticosteroid use. Among patients with osteoporosis, the initiation of physical therapy within 6 weeks after surgery also increased the risk of ASF. Patients who underwent surgical treatment of ASFs had a revision arthroplasty rate of 7.0% compared to a rate of 3.2% among those with conservatively managed fractures. Conclusion: ASFs are infrequent complications that can occur after RTSA. Preoperative factors that affect the quality of bone independently increase the fracture risk. Moreover, this risk can be minimized by avoiding shoulder corticosteroid injections 3 months before surgery and delaying physical therapy exercises among patients with osteoporosis. Surgical fixation of these fractures should be reserved for instances when conservative management has failed given high rates of infection, instability, and revision shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Background: Cutibacterium acnes remains the most commonly detected organism in shoulder arthroplasty. C acnes infection is thought to occur during shoulder arthroplasty through contamination of the surgical field with C acnes from the incised dermis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether using electrocautery for making skin incisions would decrease C acnes culture rates at the incised dermis compared to using scalpels during shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: Patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups, electrocautery vs. scalpel incision group. All patients received a standard preoperative antiseptic preparation including chlorhexidine gluconate showers, intravenous antibiotic administration, and topical application of hydrogen peroxide, povidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol, and DuraPrep. Cultures were obtained from the incised dermal edge immediately after skin incision and later from surgeon's gloves and forceps immediately prior to humeral component implantation. The primary outcome was positive C acnes culture rates compared between the groups. Results: A total of 64 patients (32 in each group) were enrolled. There were 24 males in each group. Regarding dermis cultures, 10 patients (31%) in the scalpel group were positive with 8 of them positive for C acnes, whereas no patients in the electrocautery group were positive (P < .001). Regarding glove cultures, the electrocautery group had 8 patients positive C acnes, while the scalpel group had 8 (P = .777). Regarding forceps cultures, the electrocautery group had 4 patients positive for C acnes, and the scalpel group had 6 (P = .491). All positive cultures were exclusively from male patients. There were no wound complications or infection in the electrocautery group while the scalpel group had 1 acute postoperative infection. Conclusions: Making skin incisions using electrocautery resulted in 0 C acnes culture at the incised dermis, suggesting its potential effect against C acnes. However, despite this initial antibacterial effect, C acnes still appeared on surgeon's gloves and forceps during surgery of male patients. All positive cultures were from male patients, suggesting that the source of C acnes was specifically related to the male body. While the study hypothesis was supported by the results, the present study also raises new questions and calls for further research.

N2  - Granulomatous dermatitis is a common tissue reaction pattern seen in the skin or systematically in various presentations. Granulomatous dermatitis can be subclassified into infectious and non-infectious categories. This article focuses on a patient with non-infectious granulomatous dermatitis followed for many years. Past medical history included bilateral total shoulder arthroplasty complicated by prosthetic joint infections. In its early stages, the axillary rash was painful and had many fluid-filled blisters. Ultimately, the histology of the rash deemed the lesion non-infectious and mostly due to an inflammatory process. Specifically, ionizing radiation was used for this patient. The category of granulomatous processes is broad and there are many subtypes. Other treatment options for non-infectious granulomatous processes may include corticosteroids, phototherapy, and interferon-gamma injections. The differential for granulomatous processes is extensive and treatment should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

N2  - Objectives: Repeat endoscopic dilation (ED) in the operating room for subglottic stenosis (SGS) remains an economic burden to patients. The cost-effectiveness (CE) of adjuvant serial intralesional steroid injections (SILSI) to prolong the surgery-free interval (SFI) in SGS patients requiring ED has yet to be studied. Methods: Details of the cost of SILSI and ED were received from our tertiary academic center. SFI, cost of intervention, and the effect of SILSI on prolonging SFI were collected from a systematic review by Luke et al. SGS etiologies in the review included idiopathic, iatrogenic, or autoimmune. A break-even analysis, comparing the cost of SILSI alone with the cost of repeat ED, was performed to determine if SILSI injections were cost-effective in prolonging the SFI. Results: Average extension of the SFI with SILSI was an additional 219.3 days compared to ED alone based on a systematic review of the literature. 41/55 (74.5%) cases did not require further ED once in-office SILSI management began. SILSI administered in a 4-dose series in 3-to-7-week intervals (~$7,564.00) is CE if the reported recurrence rate of SGS requiring ED (~$39,429.00) has an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of at least 19.18% with the use of SILSI. Based on the literature, SILSI prevents ~3 out of every 4 cases of SGS at sufficient follow-up from undergoing repeat ED, resulting in an ARR of ~75%. Conclusions: SILSI is economically reasonable if it prolongs the SFI of at least one case of recurrence out of 5. SILSI, therefore, can be CE in extending the interval for surgical ED. Level of Evidence: NA Laryngoscope, 133:3436–3442, 2023.

N2  - Background: Supplemental testosterone use among patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty can increase the Cutibacterium acnes load on the skin. Although higher C acnes loads on the skin are associated with higher amounts of bacteria in deep tissues, it is unknown whether preoperative testosterone use increases the risk of shoulder prosthetic joint infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a temporal relationship between testosterone use and the risk of prosthetic joint infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: The PearlDiver database was queried to identify a cohort of patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty, anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty) with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes were used to compare the demographics and comorbidities of patients with (n = 2285) and without testosterone use (n = 41,712). Patients with testosterone use were further stratified by the duration between last testosterone use and surgery. Prosthetic joint infection rates were compared between those with and without testosterone use. Results: The overall prevalence of testosterone use was 3.4%. Patients who used testosterone within 6 months prior to shoulder arthroplasty had a significantly higher rate of prosthetic joint infection at 3.4% compared to those without use at 2.4% [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-2.01), P = .042]. However, patients who used testosterone between 6 and 12 months before surgery did not have a significantly higher rate of infection. On multivariate analysis, only younger age [OR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99), P < .001] and diabetes [OR = 1.26 (95% CI: 1.10-1.44), P < .001] were independent risk factors for the development of an infection. Conclusion: Testosterone use within 6 months of shoulder arthroplasty may be associated with higher rates of prosthesis joint infection. However, patients who were taking testosterone but stopped before surgery did not have a higher rate of infection compared to those who never used the medication. Surgeons should actively screen patients for testosterone use. A referral to the patient's endocrinologist to discuss the risks and benefits of testosterone cessation prior to shoulder arthroplasty may also be warranted.

N2  - Background: The relationship between total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) volume and overall postoperative cost is unclear. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of surgeon volume on total 1-year postoperative costs. Methods: An observational cohort study was performed utilizing Marketscan databases. Patients undergoing inpatient TSAs between January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2019 were included. Patients with ICD-10 Diagnosis codes of trauma, fracture, or shoulder cancer were excluded. Surgeon volume was calculated as the maximum annual volume between 2017 and 2018. The primary outcome was total 1-year postoperative costs, including revision and nonoperative costs. Secondary outcomes were rates of revision and nonoperative procedures. Results: The analyzed study population consisted of 2,216 patients from 1,255 surgeons. Patients operated on by high-volume surgeons were more likely to be older, live in the Northeast and/or metropolitan area, and to have a reverse TSA performed. Total 1-year postoperative costs were lower for high-volume surgeons with an inverse relationship with surgeon volume (high:$1,925 medium:$1,715, low:$1,193, P<.001). Physical therapy rates (high: 76.7%, medium: 82.0%, low: 86.6%, P<.001) and costs (high:$1,223, medium: $1,655, low: $1,870, P< .001) were lowest for high-volume surgeons. Conclusion: High-volume surgeons were associated with lower 1-year postoperative costs with revisions and PT as the main driver of these costs. These improved outcomes may reflect surgeon skill and experience. Further research is necessary to establish standardized guidelines for postoperative PT regimen.

N2  - Background: Interscalene nerve block (INB) is an effective technique to provide postoperative analgesia for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). However, the analgesic effects of the block typically resolve between 8 and 24 hours postadministration, which results in rebound pain and subsequent increased opioid use. The objective of this study was to address this issue by determining how adding an intraoperative periarticular injection (PAI) in combination with INB affects acute postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in patients undergoing TSA. We hypothesized that compared with INB alone, INB + PAI will significantly reduce opioid consumption and pain scores for the first 24 hours postsurgery. Methods: We reviewed 130 consecutive patients who underwent elective primary TSA at a single tertiary institution. The first 65 patients were treated with INB alone, followed by 65 patients treated with INB + PAI. The INB used was 15-20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine. The PAI used was 50 mL of a combination of ropivacaine (123 mg), epinephrine (0.25 mg), clonidine (40 μg), and ketorolac (15 mg). The PAI was injected using a standardized protocol: 10 mL into the subcutaneous tissues prior to incision, 15 mL into the supraspinatus fossa, 15 mL at the base of the coracoid process, and 10 mL into the deltoid and pectoralis muscles—a protocol analogous with a previously described technique. For all patients, a standardized postoperative oral pain medication protocol was used. The primary outcome was acute postoperative opioid consumption represented by morphine equivalent units (MEUs), whereas the secondary outcome was visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores over the first 24 hours postsurgery, operative time, length of stay, and acute perioperative complications. Results: No significant differences in demographics existed between patients who received INB alone vs. INB + PAI. Patients who received INB + PAI had a significantly lower 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption compared to the INB alone group (38.6 ± 30.5 MEU vs. 60.5 ± 37.3 MEU, P <.001). Additionally, VAS pain scores for the first 24 hours postsurgery in the INB + PAI group were significantly lower compared to those for the INB alone group (2.9 ± 1.5 vs. 4.3 ± 1.6, P ≤.001). No differences existed between groups regarding operative time, length of inpatient stay, and acute perioperative complications. Conclusion: Patients undergoing TSA with INB + PAI demonstrated significantly decreased 24-hour postoperative total opioid consumption and 24-hour postoperative pain scores compared to the group treated with INB alone. No increase in acute perioperative complications related to PAI was observed. Thus, compared to an INB, the addition of an intraoperative periarticular cocktail injection appears to be a safe and effective method to reduce acute postoperative pain following TSA.

N2  - Background: Amidst a national opioid crisis, increased focus has been placed on reducing opioid consumption. Novel multimodal pain protocols including the use of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) have shown success in minimizing opioid usage after orthopedic surgery. There is disputing evidence of the effectiveness of LB use in shoulder surgery and the purpose of our study was to analyze the risk factors and determinants of LB failure for postoperative pain control after orthopedic shoulder surgeries. Methods: A retrospective review of 121 patients undergoing shoulder surgery treated by 2 fellowship-trained shoulder surgeons at a single institution was performed from 2018-2020. All patients received a standardized multimodal pain management protocol that included an LB interscalene block. Local infiltration of LB was also administered at closure. Visual analog scales (VASs) were administered at 24, 48, 72 hours, and 7 days postoperatively. LB failure was defined as visual analog scale score >7 any time within the 7-day postoperative period. Twenty-one patients were included in the liposomal bupivacaine failure (LBF) group and 100 in the liposomal bupivacaine success (LBS) group. Patient demographics, pain scores, and opioid consumption were compared between groups. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable, except the LBF cohort had a greater proportion of females (P =.03). The LBF group had 20% of patients with a history of chronic opioid use compared to none in the LBS group (P =.003). Logistic regression showed strong and independent associations between failure of LB and performing surgeon, chronic opioid use, gender, and history of prior surgery. Patients in the LBF group had an average of 20 total morphine equivalents 7-14 days following surgery compared to 0 total morphine equivalents (P =.002) in the LBS group, and an average of 2.9 opioid prescriptions within the first 6 months compared to 1.7 in the LBS group (P =.028). Conclusion: Performing surgeon, gender, history of opioid use, and prior surgeries were all identified as strong, independent predictor variables of LB failure. In this study, performing surgeon is likely indicative of the impact of differences in patient education on postoperative pain expectations and alternate treatments. We recommend that surgeons incorporate further preoperative patient education, and to take into account, the specific risk factors when deciding to incorporate LB into their multimodal postoperative pain management plan for patients undergoing shoulder surgery.

N2  - Background: The influence of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) on postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not yet been clarified. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of ScienceTM, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library databases to identify eligible studies published up to August 2023. All studies comparing postoperative SSI or VTE rates in RA patients with or without bDMARD treatment were included. The protocol for this study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021246264) and is available on the University of York website. Results: Overall, 20 studies with 71,885 RA patients and 6 studies with 7918 RA patients were included for postoperative SSI and VTE comparisons, respectively. Patients treated with bDMARDs had significantly higher rates of postoperative SSI than those without treatment (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.23-1.83, P<.0001). However, these significant differences disappeared in the analysis restricted to 9 studies involving non-tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors. The use of bDMARDs seemed to increase the rate of postoperative VTE (odds ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.30-3.72, P=.003). A subgroup analysis showed that postoperative osseous complications were significantly less frequent in RA patients with bDMARD treatment than in those without treatment. Conclusion: RA patients treated with bDMARDs had an increased risk of not only postoperative SSI but also VTE. While bDMARD usage merits appropriate attention, there might be positive aspects as well. Further data will be needed to confirm the postoperative risks of bDMARD usage in RA patients.

N2  - Introduction and importance: Heterotopic ossification (HO) often arises in response to trauma, prior surgical procedures, neurological injuries, or burns. However, its presentation as a complication of shoulder arthroscopy is uncommon and can sometimes lead to functional impairment. In our study, we report a case of HO complicating rotator cuff repair, along with details of the surgical treatment and subsequent progression. Case presentation: We report the case of a 45-year-old man with no medical history, who had undergone a rotator cuff arthroscopic repair of his left shoulder. Despite initial improvements, he developed intense pain and stiffness of the operated shoulder. X-rays revealed an extensive HO. Surgical revision and excision of the ossification, followed by high-dose indomethacin in combination with proton pump inhibitors and specialized physiotherapy, resulted in remarkable improvement in shoulder function. Clinical discussion: Studies investigating HO in shoulder arthroplasty have unveiled a diverse range of formation rates, spanning from 15 % to 62 %. Nonetheless, it's noteworthy that the prevalence of HO around the shoulder remains less common in comparison to other anatomical sites, especially in the context of arthroscopic surgical procedures. The exact mechanism and pathophysiology that leads to HO formation remains unknown. It is believed to stem from a combination of multiple factors and is associated with various contributors. Arthroscopic intervention, coupled with high-dose Indomethacin, offers an effective approach for managing HO. Conclusion: While HO remains an uncommon complication after shoulder arthroscopy, it is crucial for clinicians to consider it in patients experiencing post-surgery stiffness and pain.

N2  - Background and aims: Previous trials favoured a continuous interscalene brachial plexus block over a single injection for major shoulder surgery. However, these trials did not administer a multimodal analgesic regimen. The null hypothesis of this randomised, controlled trial is that a continuous infusion of local anaesthetic after a single injection for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide additional analgesia after major shoulder surgery in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. Methods: Sixty patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomised to receive a bolus of ropivacaine 0.5%, 20mL, with or without a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.5% 4-8 mL.h-1, for an interscalene brachial plexus block. Patients were provided with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and on movement, and functional outcomes, measured over 48h after surgery. Results: Median (interquartile range) cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24h postoperatively was 10mg (4- 24) in the continuous infusion group and 14mg (8-26) in the single injection group (p = 0.74). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the secondary outcomes. Conclusions: A continuous infusion of local anaesthetics after a single injection for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide additional analgesia after major shoulder surgery in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. The findings of this study are limited by performance and detection biases.

N2  - Introduction: Adrenal hemorrhage is a heterogeneous disorder with various clinical presentations. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage can result in acute adrenal insufficiency that can be fatal. With the increasing use of DOAC, cases of anticoagulation therapy induced adrenal hemorrhage have been reported. We present a rare case of unilateral adrenal hemorrhage in a patient with preexisting adrenal myelolipoma after using Aspirin. Based on our literature search, previously only two cases of Aspirin Induced adrenal hemorrhage in a stable adrenal mass have been reported. Case Presentation: 55-year-old male with history of stable 6.2 cm right adrenal gland myelolipoma, fatty liver disease and hypertension, recent use of 2 doses 81 mg Aspirin after receiving right shoulder replacement surgery presented to emergency department with acute onset right sided flank pain, constant, radiating to the back and right upper quadrant associated with an episode of vomiting. He was hemodynamically stable. Blood work showed normal electrolytes, liver function and renal function at baseline. Hemoglobin was stable around 10g/dL. CT scan abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed increase in the size of a previously stable adrenal myelolipoma to 12.9 x 15.6 cm with mass effect upon the liver. Acute hemorrhage was suspected with the blood extending beyond the margins of the mass into the right retroperitoneal space, displacing the right kidney. On admission, aspirin was discontinued. With absence of hemodynamic instability, normal electrolytes, and normal AM cortisol level of 11.9 mcg/dL, adrenal insufficiency was ruled out. Hormonal work up for hyperfunctioning adrenal tumor was performed that ruled out pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome and Primary Aldosteronism. With symptomatic improvement, absence of progression of adrenal hemorrhage on repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis, patient was discharged home. He received IR guided embolization of the right superior adrenal artery and middle adrenal artery in the outpatient setting. Discussion: Spontaneous adrenal gland hemorrhage is a rare event. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is associated with acute adrenal insufficiency that can be fatal. Major risk factors for adrenal hemorrhage include anticoagulant therapy, heparin Induced thrombocytopenia, hypercoagulable state, trauma and sever sepsis. Here we have reported a rare case of adrenal gland hemorrhage with therapeutic dose of aspirin used after orthopedic surgery. Aspirin is a very commonly used medication and high index of suspicion is required to avoid this side effect as Immediate discontinuation of the medication is necessary to prevent progression of the disease. Conclusion: Aspirin use can be associated with progression of stable benign adrenal tumors by causing spontaneous hemorrhage. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for timely recognition of this side effect.

N2  - Introduction: Corticosteroid injections (CSI) may increase the risk of peri-prosthetic infections (PJI) following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Our study specifically assessed the risk of PJI in patients who received CSI: (1) less than 4 weeks prior to TSA; (2) 4–8 weeks prior to TSA; and (3) 8–12 weeks prior to TSA. Materials and methods: A national all-payer database was queried to identify patients who underwent TSA with a shoulder osteoarthritis diagnosis from October 1, 2015 to October 31, 2020 (n = 25,422). There were four cohorts: CSI within 4 weeks of TSA (n = 214), CSI 4–8 weeks prior to TSA (n = 473), CSI 8–12 weeks prior to TSA (n = 604), and a control cohort that did not receive CSI (n = 15,486). Bivariate chi-square analyses of outcomes were performed in addition to multivariate regression. Results: A significant increase in PJI risk at 1 year (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.19–3.99, p = 0.007) and 2 years (OR = 2.03, CI = 1.09–3.46, p = 0.016) in patients who received CSI within 1 month of TSA was noted. PJI risk was not significantly increased at any time point for patients who received a CSI greater than 4 weeks prior to TSA (all p ≥ 0.396). Conclusion: PJI risk is increased at both 1 and 2 years post-operatively in patients who received a CSI within 4 weeks of TSA. Therefore, TSA should be deferred at least 4 weeks after a patient receives a CSI to mitigate PJI risk. Level of evidence: Level III.

N2  - Background: Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GOA) is associated with disabling shoulder pain that affects everyday life. Its management comprises various treatment approaches, both conservative and surgical. Regenerative medicine has gained a major role in the conservative treatment of osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injection of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) is a widely used regenerative medicine approach. The aim of this retrospective study was to report the safety and clinical outcomes of intra-articular injection of ADMSCs in patients with GOA over 36-months. Methods: This retrospective observational study involved patients with chronic shoulder pain resistant to standard conservative treatment and a diagnosis of concentric GOA, who received an intra-articular injection of autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue (μFAT). The values of the Constant–Murley score (CMS), the visual analog scale (VAS), and the simple shoulder test (SST), collected at baseline and at 12, 24, and 36 months, were analyzed to assess treatment efficacy. The single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE) was used to rate patient satisfaction. The Friedman test was used to compare observations of CMS, VAS, and SST values repeated on the same subjects. The significance threshold was set at 0.05. Results: The participants were 65 patients with a mean age of 54.19 years and a nearly equal gender distribution. Most had mild concentric GOA classified as Samilson–Prieto grade 1. The mean follow-up duration was 44.25 months. The postoperative clinical scores showed significant improvement. At 36 months, the CMS was 84.60, the VAS score was 3.34, and the SST score was 10.15 (all p < 0.0001). The SANE score at 36 months indicated that 54 patients (83.08%) were completely satisfied with the treatment. Conclusion: ADMSC treatment exerted favorable effects on the clinical outcomes of patients with GOA, providing pain relief and improving shoulder function. Our data support its use as a conservative treatment option for osteoarthritis.

N2  - Background: This study investigates the association between aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), a noninvasive measure of liver function, and 30-day postoperative complications following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all patients who underwent TSA between 2015 and 2021. The study population was divided into 4 groups based on preoperative APRI: normal/reference (APRI ≤ 0.5), mild fibrosis (0.5 < APRI ≤ 0.7), significant fibrosis (0.7 < APRI ≤ 1), and cirrhosis (APRI > 1). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the connection between preoperative APRI and postoperative complications. Results: Compared to the reference group, significant fibrosis was independently associated with a greater likelihood of major complications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.99; P = .017), minor complications (OR: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.67-4.37; P < .001), pneumonia (OR: 5.78, 95% CI: 2.58-12.95; P < .001), blood transfusions (OR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.57-5.32; P < .001), readmission (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.10-3.21; P = .022), and non-home discharge (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.73; P = .003). Cirrhosis was independently associated with a greater likelihood of minor complications (OR: 3.96, 95% CI: 2.67-5.88; P < .001), blood transfusions (OR: 5.85, 95% CI: 3.79-9.03; P < .001), failure to wean off a ventilator (OR: 9.10, 95% CI: 1.98-41.82; P = .005), and non-home discharge (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.43-2.96; P < .001). Conclusion: Increasing preoperative APRI was associated with an increasing rate of postoperative complications following TSA.

N2  - Deep infection is a debilitating complication after shoulder arthroplasty. The authors hypothesized that an intra-articular, intraoperative injection of antibiotics would result in a lower infection rate compared with intravenous antibiotics alone. Before 2007, 164 patients (group A) did not receive intra-articular antibiotics. From 2007 to 2018, 1324 patients (group B) received intra-articular antibiotics. Patients received intra-articular gentami-cin at the end of surgery with the addition of 1 g of cefazolin in January 2014. Records were retrospectively reviewed for comorbidities, type of surgery, and infection. The cohort that received intra-articular antibiotics was compared with the cohort that did not to determine the effect of prophylactic intra-articular antibiotic administration in preventing infection. There was 1 deep infection in the antibiotic group compared with 5 in the non-antibiotic group (P<.001). Superficial infections developed in 2 cases of patients treated with antibiotics; there were no superficial infections in patients treated without antibiotics (P=.62). One previous study evaluated intra-articular injection of antibiotics for shoulder arthroplasty and found significantly lower rates of infection with the injection of intra-articular gentamicin. In this retrospective follow-up study, the injection of intra-articular gentamicin or gentamicin and cefazolin effectively decreased rates of postoperative infection. At mean follow-up of 399 days, intra-articular antibiotics at the time of surgery resulted in significantly fewer deep infections. Given the minimal risk of adverse events and minimal cost, this is a valid method of reducing infections in total shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Background: Limited evidence is available for the management of recurrent glenohumeral instability caused by acute anterior glenoid fractures (AAGF). We present a retrospective review of patients treated with an acute open Latarjet procedure for recurrent instability due to comminuted AAGF. Methods: 19 patients were operated on by a single surgeon at a single centre, undergoing standardised rehabilitation. 18 patients with complete clinical and radiological data (pre- and postoperative CT scans) and minimum 2 years follow-up were available. Preoperative fracture characteristics including glenoid involvement (PICO method), displacement and associated injuries were documented. The recorded outcomes included range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain, Walch-Duplay score (WDS), Rowe score (RS), Oxford Shoulder Instability Score (OSIS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), satisfaction rating and documentation of complications. Results: The patients had a median number of 2.5 preoperative instability episodes with 50% involving the dominant shoulder and 63% were males. The injury to surgery time was 10.6 days with a median age at surgery of 58 years and median follow-up of 28 months. Preoperative CT scan confirmed comminuted AAGF with median 8mm displacement involving 16% of the glenoid. 2 patients had associated greater tuberosity fractures and another 2 had full thickness rotator cuff tears, which were also treated accordingly. After surgery, the median range of motion showed elevation of 160°, external rotation in adduction of 50° and internal rotation to T12 level (8 points) with external and internal rotations in abduction 75° and 75°. 88% were satisfied, post-operative VAS was 2 with WDS 85, RS 85, OSIS 43 and SSV 88%. There were 2 (11%) elderly females with recurrent instabilities: 1 due to bone-graft fracture and 1 due to rotator cuff re-tear, both required revisions to reverse shoulder arthroplasty with final SSV of 90%. Other complications included: a delayed bone-graft union (due to partial fixation failure) and 2 patients with frozen shoulder required hydrodilatation injection. Conclusions: The acute open Latarjet procedure provides good outcomes with acceptable complication rates in the short-term, for symptomatic AAGF lesions. It is an effective treatment option and a safe alternative to arthroscopic or open glenoid fracture fixations.

N2  - Background: Subacromial and intraarticular corticosteroid injections are well-known short-term treatments used with the intent of reducing pain and improving function as a first line treatment for patients with shoulder pathology. However, little is known about the preoperative effect of steroid injections in patients who eventually undergo shoulder replacement surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect ipsilateral steroid injection on preoperative function and pain scores for patients who eventually undergo shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on 347 patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty by a single fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon from 2017-2020. Patients were divided into two groups: non-injection SA group (NG) versus injection SA group (IG), using criteria of at least one injection within 1 year prior to surgery. Patient demographics, range of motion (ROM), patient reported pain, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES) were collected from latest preoperative visit and analyzed between groups. Results: The overall cohort had 54% females with an average age of 70.5 years and BMI of 29.7. There were 268 patients in the OG group and 75 patients in the IG group with a mean time from injection to surgery of 6.5 months. The IG had significantly more females (72% vs 49%; p<0.01) and older average age (73.3 vs 69.9; p = 0.016). The IG had significantly greater ROM for active forward flexion (83.6º vs. 73.6º; p = 0.04) and active abduction (74.3º vs. 62.3º; p <0.01). There was no significant difference in patient reported pain (p = 0.21) or ASES score (p = 0.42). Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that patients who receive steroid injections within 1 year of shoulder arthroplasty have better ROM and comparable pain, satisfaction, and ASES scores at the time of preoperative visit. This may have an important impact on patient outcomes after Shoulder arthroplasty as better preoperative function has been demonstrated to positively impact postoperative outcomes. However more research needs to be done to further elucidate which patients might benefit from a steroid injection prior to SA and if there may negative tradeoffs.

N2  - Background: Glenoid loosening is the most common mid- to long-term complication of conventional shoulder arthroplasty with cemented or metal backed glenoid components, especially in eccentric glenoid deformity. Moreover, the non-physiological kinetics of components with spherical geometry is in discussion as cause of premature PE wear. Therefore, since 2018 we use a new stemless ATSA with both, non-spherical design and full metal glenoid and PE humeral head in most cases of osteoarthritis with intact rotator cuff. Methods: From 2019-2022 we operated on 102 shoulders of 98 patients after 3D pre-OP planning and followed our first 20 cases prospectively till 12/2022 with a mean FU of 2.7 years (3.1-4.7 years) to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of this new type of implant. The mean age was 65 years (53-81). We corrected in 10 patients > 10° retroversion and in 6 > 10° superior inclination by reaming and autologous bone graft. The clinical FU included the DASH and Constant score, the radiological FU X-rays in 3 planes. Results: We found mostly good and excellent results in all cases with an improvement of CS score from 24.6 to 66.2 P, DASH score from 66 to 26. Active elevation improved from 110° to 161°, VAS score improvement from pre-OP 7,3 to 1.2. There were no signs of aseptic loosening or radiolucency lines nor PE wear and, osseointegration and healing of the bone grafts in all cases. In all cases of B2 deformity recentering of posterior subluxation was observed. There was a trend to lateralisation of COR post-OP. Complications: 1 partial temporary (sensitive) plexus lesion after ISC block and one LG infection (Cutibact.) after multiple corticoid injections and positive histology in biopsies taken at first surgery. The latter was successfully revised (converted to RSA) in a one stage procedure 10 weeks later. Conclusions: The new design fulfilled in the mid-term all our expectations. No specific complications of the new design were observed. Because we feel that even after FU of more than 5 years glenoid loosening will be very rare, we extended our indication to B2/B3 deformities to less than 30° of retroversion.

N2  - Background: Steroid injections are well-known short-term treatments for glenohumeral osteoarthritis; however, many patients eventually require more definitive management with surgical treatment. Recent literature has called into question the utility and safety of steroid injections prior to shoulder surgery regarding their effect on infections and revision rates. Conclusive data regarding the relationship of preoperative injection and postoperative outcomes is lacking. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ipsilateral preoperative injections on clinical outcomes following shoulder arthroplasty (SA). Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 563 patients who underwent SA by a single fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon from 2017-2020. Patients were divided into two groups: 240 who received a preoperative injection (IG) and 323 were the control group (CG). Patient reported pain and satisfaction, simple shoulder test (SST), shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), complications, reoperations, and range of motion (ROM) were compared between groups. Change (delta) in clinical and functional outcomes were calculated from the pre- to postoperative period and compared. Results: The cohort was comprised of 55% females with an average age of 71.1, BMI of 29.6, and mean follow-up of 21.5 months. The IG group had a significantly greater proportion of females (64%; p<0.01) and older age of 72.9 (p<0.01). The number of comorbidities between groups was comparable. There was a significantly greater postoperative improvement in range of motion with forward elevation (70 vs. 80, p=0.025) and abduction (60 vs. 70, p=0.030) in patients who did not have a corticosteroid injection within the past year. Patients in the IG group had significantly greater delta in reported outcomes on the SST (+6.25 vs. +5.37, p = 0.005). Patient satisfaction, complication rates (p=0.98) and reoperation rates (p=0.98) were comparable between groups. Conclusions: Ipsilateral shoulder injections lead to inferior functional outcomes, specifically abduction and forward elevation, with superior patient reported outcomes and no concurrent increase in complications. Surgeons can consider maintaining injections as a viable first line management option for SA candidates without concern for inferior postoperative outcomes.

N2  - Background: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has significantly grown over the last two decades due to its expanding indications. Given this increase, it is essential for the orthopedic surgeon to communicate the expected postoperative recovery timing to patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of recovery following RSA and factors influencing this rate. Methods: A retrospective review of 2132 patients who underwent RSA by a single surgeon was conducted. Data was collected preoperatively and postoperatively at intervals of 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months. At each follow-up period the cohort was divided into either a recovered or still recovering group. Patients with an American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES) of 70 or greater were defined as recovered, based on previously validated studies, compared to those with a score of less than 70 being defined as still recovering. Both the demographic and range of motion data was compared between the cohorts at each follow-up period. Results: The recovered group included 36.4% at 3-months, 56.7% at 6-months, 71.8% at 12-months, and 70.5% at 24-months. At 6 months, the recovered and still-recovering groups had significantly more females (70.0% and 56.3% respectively; p=0.02). At 24-months, there was a significant higher preoperative BMI for the recovered group compared to the still recovering group (30.15 versus 28.14 respectively, p=0.04). Previous shoulder surgery, preoperative injection, and subscapularis repair were comparable between groups at each follow up period. Postoperative abduction was significantly greater in the recovered group at 12-months. Active forward elevation and external rotation were not significantly greater in the recovered group at 6-, 12-, and 24 months. Conclusions: It appears that perhaps female patients and those patients who gain postoperative abduction are more likely to reach recovery slightly faster than other cohorts. This information can allow clinicians to inform their patients of expected recovery times more accurately where more than a third of patients reach the recovery threshold by 3 months, and a majority by 12 months postoperative. Patients who had previous injections, variations in subscapularis management or prior shoulder surgery did not see an impact in their overall recovery rates for RSA.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the pain level and the amount of opioid consumed in postoperative total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) patients who were treated with a standard opioid-including regimen versus a non-opioid multimodal analgesia regimen. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed two consecutive cohorts who underwent TSA—either anatomic or reverse—by a single surgeon. The opioid cohort included patients from early 2016 to late 2020 and were given 80 tablets of Percocet 5 mg/325 mg that followed a dose reduction plan to 60, 40, and 20 tablets for consecutive refills (max of 3 refills). The non-opioid cohort included patients from late 2020 to mid 2022 and consisted of preoperative oral analgesics (Celecoxib, Pregabalin, and Tramadol); intraoperative IV Dexamethasone and Acetaminophen, and local infiltration of Ropivacaine, Epinephrine and Ketorolac; and postoperative oral Dexamethasone and oral analgesics (Pregabalin, Tizanidine, Magnesium, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain (preoperative, and 10-days, 6-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months postoperative) and opioid consumption (preoperative, and 10-days, 6-weeks, and 3-months postoperative) using Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) were compared and analyzed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test for both cohorts. Total MME was calculated as max consumption. Results: There were 249 patients in the opioid cohort and 127 in the non-opioid cohort. No between-group differences were found in demographic factors—including age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status—or anatomic versus reverse TSA. Patients treated with the non-opioid protocol had lower mean VAS scores at preoperative (6.4 vs 7.4, p<0.05), 10-day (3.5 vs 4.2, p<0.05), and 6-week postoperative time points (2.1 vs 2.8, p<0.05). Opioid consumption was lower in the non-opioid multimodal cohort at all time periods (p<0.005). Complications such as 90-day hospital readmissions and revision surgery at one-year were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions: A non-opioid multimodal postoperative regime is reliable and well tolerated by patients undergoing Total Shoulder Arthroplasty. They have lower early postoperative VAS scores (10-days and 6-weeks) and a significant reduction in opioid utilization. One-year postoperative complications between both groups were similar indicating that a non-opioid regimen is effective in safely controlling postoperative pain.

N2  - Background: Perioperative corticosteroids have shown promise as a non-opioid analgesic adjunct for various orthopaedic pathologies. However, there is a paucity of studies investigating the role of corticosteroids in the postoperative setting after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a methylprednisolone taper on a multimodal pain regimen after TSA. Methods: This study is a randomized control trial, clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03661645), of a group of opioid naïve patients undergoing TSA. Patients were randomly assigned at the time of surgery to receive intraoperative dexamethasone only (control group) or intraoperative dexamethasone followed by a 6-day oral methylprednisolone (Medrol) taper course (treatment group). All patients received the same standardized perioperative pain management protocol. A pain journal was used to record visual analog pain scores (VAS-pain), VAS-nausea, and number of opioid tablets consumed during the first 7 post-operative days (POD). Patients were seen at 2-weeks, 6-weeks, and 12-weeks post-operatively for clinical evaluation and collection of patient-reported outcomes. Results: Overall, there were 67 patients enrolled in the study, including 32 in the control group and 35 in the treatment group. There was a reduction in the mean VAS pain scores and in cumulative oxycodone tablet consumption (control group = mean of 18 pills vs. treatment group = 4.2 pills) in the first postoperative week. Patients also had less opioid-related side effects, including nausea, within this first postoperative week. Although there was an improvement in VAS pain score in the treatment group at 2 weeks postoperatively, there were no differences at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, or at final follow-up. There were no differences in EQOL, shoulder SANE, or ASES scores at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, or 12 weeks postoperatively, or at final follow-up, between the groups. At a follow-up of 23.4 (12-39) months in the control group and 19.4 (12-37) months in the treatment group, there was 1 infection in the control group and 1 postoperative cubital tunnel in the treatment group. Conclusions: A methylprednisolone taper course shows promise in reducing acute pain and opioid consumption as part of a multimodal regimen following TSA.

N2  - Background and Aims A 59yr old male came with complaints of difficulty in left shoulder movement since 8months associated with pain. On MRI, it was diagnosed as diffuse large B cell lymphoma measuring 20X22X82mm with healed pathological fracture of left proximal humerus. He was advised for left proximal humerus excision with shoulder arthroplasty. Methods On the day of surgery, patient was shifted to OT, monitors connected, IV cannula established. Patient did not want to undergo surgery with regional anaesthesia. Hence surgery was done under general anaesthesia. With this extensive surgery and as patient had previous history of pain, multiple blocks was planned in order to give pain relief postoperatively. Results 0.25% bupivacaine was used in multiple ultrasoundguided blocks for analgesia and later extubated. -10ml used for selective upper trunk brachial plexus block to target dorsal scapular nerve and lower subscapular nerve. -5ml used for superficial cervical plexus block to target supraclavicular nerve. -15ml used for supraclavicular brachial plexus block to provide analgesia to area supplied by lateral pectoral nerve, suprascapular nerve and axillary nerve. -5ml given as intraarticular infiltration posteriorly as posterior part of shoulder have high concentration of mechanoreceptors. Additive Inj. Dexamethasone 6mg IV given to prolong the analgesia. Post- Operative patient had a VAS score of 1/10 and continued to have pain relief for the next 36hours. Conclusions Multiple blocks was administered for this complicated shoulder surgery to provide adequate analgesia for the patient.

N2  - Background and Aims Previous trials favoured a continuous interscalene brachial plexus block over a single injection for major shoulder surgery. However, these trials did not administer a multimodal analgesic regimen. The null hypothesis of this randomised, controlled trial is that a continuous infusion of local anaesthetic after a single injection for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide additional analgesia after major shoulder surgery in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. Methods Sixty patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomised to receive a bolus of ropivacaine 0.5%, 20mL, with or without a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.5% 4-8 mL.h-1, for an interscalene brachial plexus block. Patients were provided with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and on movement, and functional outcomes, measured over 48h after surgery. Results Median (interquartile range) cumulative intravenous morphine consumption at 24h postoperatively was 10mg (4- 24) in the continuous infusion group and 14mg (8-26) in the single injection group (p=0.74). No significant between-group differences were found for any of the secondary outcomes. Conclusions A continuous infusion of local anaesthetics after a single injection for an interscalene brachial plexus block does not provide additional analgesia after major shoulder surgery in the setting of multimodal analgesia, inclusive of intravenous dexamethasone, magnesium, acetaminophen and ketorolac. The findings of this study are limited by performance and detection biases. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background and Aims Allergy to muscular relaxants is still a big concern to Anesthesiologists. This case discusses interscalene block as an alternative to General Anesthesia in a patient with confirmed allergy to Rocuronium and Cisatracurium. Methods We report a case of 73-year-old female, ASA III, with positive skin tests to Rocuronium and Cisatracurium. Patient had a humeral fracture and was proposed for a Total Shoulder Arthroplasty. Anesthetic plan was discussed with the patient prior to the procedure and informed consent was obtained. After monitoring, the patient was given intravenous fentanyl 0,05 mg and midazolam 1mg and a dexmedetomidine perfusion was initiated. An ultrasound guided interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) and cervical plexus block (CBP) were performed using 15 mL of ropivacaine 0,5% and mepivacaine 0,6% and 5mL of ropivacaine 0,5% and mepivacaine 0,6%, respectively. Patient was positioned in beach chair. Skin incision was made 20 minutes after local anesthetic injection. Surgery lasted for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the patient only referred mild discomfort due to the sitting position nearly the end of the surgery. Patient controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine and ketamine was used post-operatively. Results There were no complications, and patient demonstrated high level of satisfaction. Conclusions Positivity of skin test reaction to neuromuscular blocking agents makes their use unsafe. A CPB along with an ISB can provide anesthesia to the roots C2 to C4 and C5 to C7, respectively. Together they represent an alternative anesthetic technique to General Anesthesia for shoulder surgery. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Purpose of Review: Periprosthetic infection after shoulder arthroplasty is relatively uncommon though associated with severe long-term morbidity when encountered. The purpose of the review is to summarize the recent literature regarding the definition, clinical evaluation, prevention, and management of prosthetic joint infection after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Recent Findings: The landmark report generated at the 2018 International Consensus Meeting on Musculoskeletal Infection has provided a framework for diagnosis, prevention, and management of periprosthetic infections after shoulder arthroplasty. Shoulder specific literature with validated interventions to reduce prosthetic joint infection is limited; however existing literature from retrospective studies and from total hip and knee arthroplasty allows us to make relative guidelines. One and two-stage revisions seem to demonstrate similar outcomes; however, no controlled comparative studies exist limiting the ability to make definitive recommendations between the two options. Summary: We report on recent literature regarding the current diagnostic, preventative, and treatment options for periprosthetic infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Much of the literature does not distinguish between anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and further high-level shoulder specific studies are needed to answer questions generated from this review.

N2  - Background: Corticosteroid injections (CSIs) are used for the symptomatic management of osteoarthritis. However, their use may contaminate the joint space and pose an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether there is any association between the timing of CSI and the incidence of PJI at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Specifically, we assessed the risk of PJI in patients who received CSI <1 month, 1-2 months, 2-3 months, and >3 months prior to RSA, as well as associated risk factors for PJI with CSI. Methods: We queried a national, all-payer database to identify patients who underwent RSA from October 1, 2015, to October 31, 2020 (1.5 million patients). Patients who received an osteoarthritis diagnosis prior to RSA were selected, whereas those with bilateral RSA or >1 injection on the same side were excluded. This resulted in 5 cohorts: cohort receiving CSI within 4 weeks of RSA (n = 5607), cohort receiving CSI 1-2 months prior to RSA (n = 3024), cohort receiving CSI 2-3 months prior to RSA (n = 1572), cohort receiving CSI >3 months prior to RSA (n = 16,302), and control cohort with no injection prior to RSA (n = 21,938). Bivariate χ2 analyses of outcomes were conducted, in addition to multivariate regressions performed to adjust for comorbidities, as well as to assess associated risk factors. Results: The adjusted analyses demonstrated a significantly increased risk of PJI at 90 days in patients who received CSI within 1 month of RSA (P < .001). Additionally, the PJI risk was increased at 1 year postoperatively in patients who received CSI within 1 month of RSA (P = .015). However, no significant increase in the PJI risk was noted at any time point for patients who received CSI >1 month before RSA (all P ≥ .088). Furthermore, alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, and depression were identified as risk factors that increased the risk of PJI. Conclusion: Intra-articular shoulder CSIs <4 weeks prior to RSA are associated with increased risks of PJI at 90 days and 1 year postoperatively as compared with patients who did not receive CSIs. RSA should be deferred ≥4 weeks after a patient receives a CSI.

N2  - Background: Interscalene nerve blocks and local anesthetic infiltration are 2 methods commonly used in multimodal analgesia regimens for shoulder arthroplasty. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel anesthetic that can be detected more than 24 hours following local administration. Studies comparing liposomal bupivacaine with conventional analgesic methods have found mixed results regarding pain and narcotic consumption, and there is little information available regarding patient satisfaction and the role of psychosocial variables. Methods: This is a randomized study of 76 adult patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty who were assigned to receive a preoperative interscalene nerve block with ropivacaine (Block = 38) or an intraoperative periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Local = 38). The primary outcomes were narcotic consumption (MEq, morphine equivalents), visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and satisfaction (0-10). The secondary outcomes were the effect of patient group preference (Block vs. Local) and psychosocial variables (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale) on satisfaction. Length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, and the number of narcotic refills were tracked from the day of surgery through the first postoperative appointment, which was routinely 7-14 days following surgery. Results: Intraoperative and day 0 narcotic consumption was lower in the Block group by 17.3 and 21.6 MEq (P < .001, P = .035) with no differences on day 1 or 2. There was no difference in VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. Patient satisfaction was higher in the Block group (8.3 vs. 6.8, P = .017). Pain catastrophizing, resilience, and patient group preference did not have any significant relationship with patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty have higher satisfaction with a conventional interscalene block compared to a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine. There were no clinically important differences in narcotic consumption, VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and patient preferences did not have any relationship with patient satisfaction.

N2  - Hypothesis: Glenoid baseplate positioning for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) is important for stability and longevity, with techniques such as image-derived instrumentation (IDI) developed for improving implant placement accuracy. We performed a single-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing glenoid baseplate insertion accuracy with 3D preoperative planning and IDI jigs vs. 3D preoperative planning and conventional instrumentation. Methods: All patients had a preoperative 3D computed tomography to create an IDI; then underwent rTSA according to their randomized method. Repeat computed tomography scans performed at six weeks postoperatively were compared to the preoperative plan to assess for accuracy of implantation. Patient-reported outcome measures and plain radiographs were collected with 2-year follow-up. Results: Forty-seven rTSA patients were included (IDI n = 24, conventional instrumentation n = 23). The IDI group was more likely to have a guidewire placement within 2mm of the preoperative plan in the superior/inferior plane (P = .01); and exhibited a smaller degree of error when the native glenoid retroversion was >10° (P = .047). There was no difference in patient-reported outcome measures or other radiographic parameters between the two groups. Conclusion: IDI is an accurate method for glenoid guidewire and component placement in rTSA, particularly in the superior/inferior plane and in glenoids with native retroversion >10°, when compared to conventional instrumentation.

N2  - Introduction: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS), used in the management of chronic focal pain, provides a viable therapeutic intervention for patients with chronic shoulder pain who have exhausted medical and surgical options. Case Report: A 62-year-old female was evaluated for severe, persistent, non-radiating, anterolateral and posterior right shoulder pain. Initial onset of pain was five years prior to evaluation and was initially treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections prior to undergoing right rotator cuff repair. This was complicated by arthrofibrosis and persistent pain, leading to surgical lysis of adhesion and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty three years after onset of pain. Unfortunately, limited range of motion and pain persisted, and the patient underwent multiple revision surgeries for lysis of adhesions without improvement. Exam was notable for guarding of the shoulder, decreased active range of motion with abduction and flexion to 80 degrees, severe tenderness to palpation of the subacromial space and multiple trigger points along the right cervical paraspinals, trapezius, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. Results: Initial treatment included trigger point injections to the right cervicothoracic and shoulder region with 20% improvement in her pain for a few weeks. Due to refractory pain, we offered right suprascapular and axillary nerve diagnostic blocks for consideration of PNS. Pre-implant pain score was 8/10. Patient had 60% improvement in pain after blocks. She then underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulator implantation using a 60-day temporary device targeting the right suprascapular and axillary nerves. The approach to the suprascapular nerve was medial to lateral, while the approach for the axillary nerve was proximal to distal. Patient noticed 25% improvement at one week, 60% at two weeks and 40% at seven weeks. Conclusion: This case describes efficacy of PNS in the treatment of refractory shoulder pain and illustrates nerve targets for this indication.

N2  - Abstract ID# 21744 All Authors: Chaiyanun Vijittrakarnrung MD THAILAND Ryan Freshman MD UNITED STATES Christopher Anigwe medical student UNITED STATES Drew Lansdown MD UNITED STATES Brian T. Feeley MD UNITED STATES C. Benjamin Ma MD UNITED STATES Summary: The addition of an intra-operative peri-articular cocktail injection appears to be a safe and effective method to reduce acute post-operative pain following TSA compared to an isolated interscalene nerve block. Data: INTRODUCTION: Interscalene nerve block (INB) is as an effective technique to provide post-operative anesthesia for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). However, the analgesic effects of the block typically resolve between 8-and 24-hours following administration, which results in rebound pain and subsequent increased opioid utilization. With the aim of transitioning the shoulder arthroplasty procedure toward out-patient surgery, decreasing opioid consumption in the acute post-operative period is the main goal to achieve a shorter hospital stay. The objective of this study was to determine the effect that the combination of INB and intra-operative peri-articular injection (PAI) has on opioid consumption and acute post-operative pain scores in patients undergoing TSA. We hypothesized that the combination of INB + PAI will significantly reduce opioid consumption and pain scores for the first 24 hours following surgery as compared to INB alone. METHODS: We reviewed 130 consecutive patients who underwent elective primary TSA at a single tertiary institution. The first 65 patients were treated with INB alone, followed by 65 patients treated with INB + PAI. The PAI utilized was 50ml of a combination of Ropivacaine (123mg), Epinephrine (0.25mg), Clonidine (40mcg), and Ketorolac (15mg). The PAI was injected using a standardized protocol; 10ml into the subcutaneous tissues prior to incision, 15ml into the supraspinatus fossa, 15ml at the base of the coracoid process, and 10ml into the deltoid and pectoralis muscles. A standardized post-operative oral pain medication protocol was utilized for all patients. The primary outcome measured was acute post-operative opioid consumption represented by morphine equivalent units (MEU), while the secondary outcome measured was Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores over the first 24 hours after surgery, operative time, length of stay, and acute peri-operative complications. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient demographics between the INB alone compared to patients with INB + PAI. Patients who received INB + PAI had a significantly lower 24-hour post-operative opioid consumption as compared to INB alone group (38.6±30.5 MEU versus 60.5±37.3 MEU, P<0.001). Moreover, the demand for rescue intravenous opioids from severe breakthrough pain was also decreased by 16.9% in INB + PAI group (20% versus 36.9%, P=0.033). Additionally, VAS pain scores for the first 24 hours following surgery in the INB + PAI group was significantly lower as compared to INB alone group (2.9±1.5 versus 4.3±1.6, P=<0.001). There were no differences between both groups in the operative time, length of inpatient stay and acute peri-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TSA with INB + PAI demonstrated significantly decreased 24-hour post-operative total opioid consumption and 24-hour post-operative pain scores as compared to group treated with INB alone. There was no observed increase in acute peri-operative complications related to PAI. Thus, the addition of an intra-operative peri-articular cocktail injection appears to be a safe and effective method to reduce acute post-operative pain following TSA compared to an isolated interscalene nerve block.

Jazrawi MD UNITED STATES Summary: The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors for the time from initial presentation to primary TSA in patients with glenohumeral OA or rotator cuff (RTC) arthropathy managed conservatively with corticosteroid injections. Data: Purpose The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of the time from initial presentation to total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) in patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) and rotator cuff (RTC) arthropathy who were conservatively managed with corticosteroid injections. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent TSA from 2010-2021. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate median time to TSA for primary OA and RTC arthropathy patients. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to identify significant predictors of time to TSA and calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Results The cohort included 160 patients with primary OA and 92 with RTC arthropathy. In the primary OA group, median time to TSA was 15 months and significant predictors of shorter time to TSA were older age at presentation (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04, P=0.03) and moderate or severe acromioclavicular joint arthritis (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05-2.01, P=0.03). In the RTC arthropathy group, median time to TSA was 14 months and increased number of corticosteroid injections was associated with longer time to TSA (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 – 0.95, P=0.003). Conclusion The time course from initial presentation to TSA is similar between primary OA and RTC arthropathy patients managed conservatively with corticosteroid injections, but there are distinct prognostic factors for progression to TSA in both groups. Multiple corticosteroid injections are associated with delayed time to TSA in RTC arthropathy patients. Level of Evidence III

N2  - Background: Many regularly prescribed classes of drugs are known to negatively impact bone health. However, it is unclear if perioperative use of these drugs impacts total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) outcomes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of perioperative use of 10 drug classes with known negative effects on bone health on prosthesis-related outcomes of TSA. Methods: Patients who underwent primary TSA were retrospectively identified in the PearlDiver database. Within this population, patients prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), loop diuretics, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) within 6 months before or 6 months after primary TSA were identified (n = 23,748). These patients were propensity score matched 1:1 with controls (n = 23,748) on age, sex, and several comorbidities. After matching, patients with perioperative drug exposure were divided into 10 subgroups (ie, 1 for each drug class). Rates of prosthesis-related complications among patients taking each medication class vs. controls were compared with multivariable logistic regression. Results: Relative to controls, SGA exposure was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause revision (odds ratio [OR] 1.68) and aseptic revision (OR 1.57). Loop diuretic exposure was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause revision (OR 1.44) and aseptic revision (OR 1.43). Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause revision (OR 1.32) and aseptic revision (OR 1.30). SSRI exposure was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause revision (OR 1.27) and aseptic revision (OR 1.24). Periprosthetic fracture, aseptic loosening, and septic revision was comparable for all drug cohorts compared to matched controls (all P > .05). Patients with perioperative exposure to PPIs, TZDs, FGAs, AEDs, aromatase inhibitors, and calcineurin inhibitors displayed comparable rates of all queried complications compared with controls (all P > .05). Conclusion: Compared with matched controls, patients with perioperative exposure to SGAs, loop diuretics, glucocorticoids and SSRIs exhibited significantly higher rates of all-cause and aseptic revisions following primary TSA. Several other medications that are risk factors for osteoporosis and fragility fractures did not demonstrate significant associations with any complications, including periprosthetic fracture. These results highlight the need for a thorough review of patients’ medical history and current medication usage prior to preoperative risk counseling for patients seeking TSA.

Materials and methods: This non-blinded, randomized clinical trial compared shoulder pain, narcotic use, interscalene (IS) block application time, and costs in 76 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either a single injection IS nerve block of 10 cc (133 mg) liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 10 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine (Group 1), or 20 cc of 0.5% ropivacaine direct injection combined with an indwelling IS nerve block catheter delivering 0.2% ropivacaine at a continual 4 cc/h infusion for the initial 3 post-operative days (Group 2). Surgical time, local anesthesia duration, hospital stay length, morphine milligram equivalents (MME) consumed, worst shoulder pain at 24, 48 and 72 h, and complications were recorded. Patient reported function, pain and activity level surveys were completed before, and 6-week post-TSA (P < 0.05). Results: Group 1 had less pain 24-h (0.72 ± 0.8 vs. 3.4 ± 2.9, p < 0.0001) and 48-h (2.5 ± 2.2 vs. 4.8 ± 2.6, p = 0.005) post-TSA. At 24-h post-TSA, MME consumption was similar (Group 1 = 4.5 ± 6.4 vs. Group 2 = 3.7 ± 3.8, p = 0.54), but was lower for Group 1 at 48 h (0.0 ± 0.0 vs. 0.64 ± 0.99, p = 0.001). Group 2 had longer IS block application time (10.00 ± 4.6 min vs. 4.84 ± 2.7 min, p < 0.0001). Only group 2 had a strong relationship between MME consumption over the first 24-h post-TSA and pain 24-h post-TSA (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001), a moderate relationship with pain 48-h post-TSA (r = 0.59, P = 0.001), and a weak relationship with pain 72-h post-TSA (r = 0.44, P = 0.02). Significant relationships for these variables were not observed for Group 1 (r ≤ 0.30, p ≥ 0.23). Group 1 IS block costs were less/patient than Group 2 ($190.17 vs. $357.12 USD). Conclusion: A single shot, liposomal bupivacaine interscalene nerve block provided better post-TSA pain control with less narcotic consumption, less time for administration and less healthcare system cost compared to interscalene nerve block using a continuous indwelling catheter. Level of evidence: Level I, Prospective, Randomized.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although initial studies have demonstrated that concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA) injections promote rotator cuff repair (RCR) healing, there are no randomized prospective studies investigating clinical efficacy. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To compare outcomes after arthroscopic RCR (aRCR) with and without cBMA augmentation. It was hypothesized that cBMA augmentation would result in statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes and rotator cuff structural integrity. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Patients indicated for aRCR of isolated 1- to 3-cm supraspinatus tendon tears were randomized to receive adjunctive cBMA injection or sham incision. Bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest, concentrated using a commercially available system, and injected at the aRCR site after repair. Patients were assessed preoperatively and serially until 2 years postoperatively via the following functional indices: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Simple Shoulder Test, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 1 year to assess rotator cuff structural integrity according to Sugaya classification. Treatment failure was defined as decreased 1- or 2-year ASES or SANE scores as compared with preoperative baseline, the need for revision RCR, or conversion to total shoulder arthroplasty. RESULTS: An overall 91 patients were enrolled (control, n = 45; cBMA, n = 46): 82 (90%) completed 2-year clinical follow-up and 75 (82%) completed 1-year MRI. Functional indices significantly improved in both groups by 6 months and were sustained at 1 and 2 years (all P < .05). The control group showed significantly greater evidence of rotator cuff retear according to Sugaya classification on 1-year MRI (57% vs 18%; P < .001). Treatment failed for 7 patients in each group (control, 16%; cBMA, 15%). CONCLUSION: cBMA-augmented aRCR of isolated supraspinatus tendon tears may result in a structurally superior repair but largely fails to significantly improve treatment failure rates and patient-reported clinical outcomes when compared with aRCR alone. Additional study is warranted to investigate the long-term benefits of improved repair quality on clinical outcomes and repair failure rates.

N2  - Background: The objective of this study was to retrospectively review clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients who had undergone hemiarthroplasty for nontraumatic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the humeral head and to review demographic and clinical factors that might affect patient outcomes. Methods: The patient sample for this study was identified through our institutional Total Joint Registry Database. Between 2009 and 2019, 68 hemiarthroplasties had been performed for nontraumatic AVN. There were 44 (64.7%) female and 24 (35.3%) male patients, with a mean age of 44.3 (range 17-78) years. The average follow-up time was 6.5 years, with a minimum of 2.1 years. There were 34 patients (50%) with an identifiable underlying etiology of steroid and/or chemotherapy use, 17 (25%) were considered idiopathic, 9 (13.2%) with a hematologic or coagulopathic condition, 6 (8.8%) with radiation, and 2 (2.9%) with a history of alcohol abuse. Outcomes, including revision surgeries, reoperations, and complications, were recorded. Range of motion (ROM) data and functional outcome scores, including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and patients’ subjective level of satisfaction with the operation, were evaluated. Preoperative radiographs were reviewed, and the degree of AVN was classified. Most recent postoperative radiographs were reviewed to assess for stem loosening, humeral head subluxation, and glenoid erosion. Results: Postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores were 74.5, and Simple Shoulder Test scores were 75.3. Overall satisfaction with the operation was rated as 7.3 on a scale of 0-10. The average external rotation was 62 degrees, and the average active elevation was 163 degrees. No differences in outcomes scores or ROM were noted based on preoperative etiology, although the idiopathic group trended toward lower forward flexion compared to the steroid/chemotherapy group. Three of 68 (4.4%) patients suffered postoperative complications. The overall revision rate was 2/68 (2.9%), both involving conversion to anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty for progressive painful glenoid erosion. Radiographically, no patients had evidence of loosening. One patient (2.2%) had mild subluxation, 2 had moderate subluxation (4.4%), and 1 had severe subluxation (2.2%) of the humeral implant. Three patients had mild (6.7%), 4 had moderate (8.9%), and 3 had severe (6.7%) glenoid erosion. Conclusion: Hemiarthroplasty for nontraumatic AVN of the humeral head provides satisfactory functional outcomes and ROM, with low complication and revision rates. These outcomes and revision rates appear to be better than those reported in the literature for posttraumatic AVN. Hemiarthroplasty may lead to radiographic evidence of glenoid erosion, but this is well tolerated and does not appear to lead to substantially high revision rates, at least in the intermediate-term follow-up.

N2  - Background: Shoulder arthroplasty (SA) is the fastest growing joint replacement surgery in the United States, and it has been estimated that postoperative pain management is not adequately controlled in up to 80% of patients. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) has been included as part of the multimodal pain management that has shown promise in reducing pain, narcotic consumption, and hospital length of stay in SAs, but there has been some controversy regarding its efficacy in the literature. This may be due to lack of standardization across studies in the utilization of LB or the lack of efficacy of local LB infiltration. The purpose of this study was to identify whether there is an optimal dilution of LB required for maximal analgesia after SA in order to direct future literature and increase the strength of evidence for recommendations in clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted with patients undergoing primary SA categorized into 40 mL, 60 mL, or 80 mL dilutions of 20 mg of LB with 0.9% normal saline. Patient-reported pain scores and opioid consumption were collected at days 1, 3, 7, and 30 postoperatively. Dependence rates were reported and defined as three months of continuous opioid use. Opioid consumption was calculated using total morphine equivalents (TME), and an analysis of variance was performed to compare outcomes between groups. Results: Seventy-four patients were identified and divided into one of three groups based on the dilution of LB received intraoperatively. There were significant differences in pain scores between the groups on day 7 postoperatively with the 80 mL group having significantly lowest pain scores (P =.012). No significant difference in opioid consumption was found between the groups during any time point. There was a trend toward fewer opioids over the study period in the 80 mL group relative to other groups. Overall, all dilution groups resulted in low TME and postoperative pain after the 30-day study period. Conclusion: All three dilution groups achieved excellent pain control and minimal opioid usage following SA. The 80 mL dilution group showed lower pain scores at day 7 postoperatively and trended toward less opioid consumption in the first 30 days. Our study suggests that, overall, orthopedic surgeons can consider using all three LB dilutions as an effective and safe option for pain management after an SA.

N2  - The best treatment approach for massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears is a complex and unsolved clinical problem. There are a variety of surgical options described in the literature and debate on the ideal treatment approach depending on the patient's shoulder pathology, preoperative function, postoperative goals, and medical co-morbidities. The subacromial balloon spacer is an innovative device, recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that can provide pain relief, reduced operative and postoperative recovery time, and has biomechanical as well as early clinical support for its use. This review will uncover the subacromial balloon spacer technology in a comprehensive fashion. We will evaluate the biomechanical data and mechanism of function, current surgical indications, intraoperative techniques, early patient outcomes, and potential avenues for future utilization.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study is to compare the 90-day complications and readmission rates between patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) in an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) with glenoid bone loss requiring an augmented glenoid component compared to patients without bone loss. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing outpatient TSA at an ASC (2018-2021). Readmission, direct transfer, and complications were recorded. Major and minor complications were compared. Secondary outcomes included operative time, estimated blood loss, range of motion, and patient-reported outcome measures. Results: There were 44 patients (45 shoulders) included in the study, 20 with augmented implants for glenoid bone loss and 25 nonaugmented with a concentric glenoid. There were no statistical differences in demographics. Two complications were seen in both the augmented and nonaugmented groups (10% vs. 8%). There were no readmissions or direct transfers. The augmented group had significantly increased preoperative glenoid retroversion (23° vs. 9°, P < .05), posterior humeral head subluxation (78% vs. 61%., P < .05), and longer operative time (124.4 min vs. 112.3 min., P < .05). Patient-specific instrumentation was used in 60% of augmented cases and 29% of nonaugmented cases. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in complications, direct transfers, or readmissions between patients with and without glenoid bone loss being treated in an outpatient ASC. The augmented group had significantly worse preoperative deformities, longer operative times, and increased utilization of patient-specific instrumentation. Outpatient TSA in the setting of glenoid bone loss requiring augmentation was found to be safe and effective at a stand-alone ASC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: American hospitals are required to provide price transparency data (known as a chargemaster) for medical services, which is intended to allow consumers to accurately estimate the cost of medical services. Our purpose was to identify hospital compliance in publishing chargemaster documents and to assess the price information published for common upper-extremity services and procedures. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of publicly available chargemaster data from 122 hospitals, which included the top-20-ranked Honor Roll hospitals from US News and World Report and 2 top-ranked hospitals from each state. Chargemaster files were accessed for each hospital, and price information was recorded for 10 common upper-extremity procedures including radiographs, injections, and surgeries. Mean procedural prices were compared between academic and nonacademic hospitals. RESULTS: Chargemaster files were able to be accessed for 107 (88%) of 122 institutions. Price estimates for imaging studies were more frequently reported (73%) than those of procedures (23%-41%). With 50 hospitals reporting a price estimate, carpal tunnel injection was the most frequently reported procedure, whereas trigger finger release was the least frequently reported (41% and 23%, respectively). Wide price ranges were noted, with mean charges for a total shoulder arthroplasty listed as US $51 723 (range, US $247-US $364 024). Mean prices between academic and nonacademic hospital systems were similar. CONCLUSIONS: While most (88%) of the included hospitals have been compliant with publishing their price transparency files, price estimates for common upper-extremity procedures and imaging studies are inconsistently reported and, when present, demonstrate high levels of price variability between and within hospital systems.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical and structural outcomes of patients with a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear treated with arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction using an acellular porcine dermal xenograft. We hypothesized that this procedure would lead to improvement in clinical and functional results and that structural failure would not influence the final clinical results. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis on arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction performed from October 2016 to January 2019 was conducted. The procedure was performed in patients with a massive irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tear without a severe glenohumeral arthropathy (Hamada I and II) and complaining a painful pseudoparalysis. Clinical evaluation and MRI study were performed before surgery and after at least 14 months. Results: A comprehensive group of 21 patients with 11 females and 10 males and a mean age of 57 ± 8.5 years underwent arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction. The graft had a thickness of 1.5 mm in the first 9 cases (43%) since it was used in a single layer. The graft was thereafter doubled for technique evolution in the following 12 cases (57%) achieving a graft thickness of 3 mm. Active ROM significantly improved with a mean increase of active forward flexion from 72.8° ± 7.5° to 120.6° ± 4.5°, active abduction from 68.3° ± 10.2° to 140.2° ± 8.8° and external rotation from 38.2° ± 11.2° to 56.7° ± 6.8° at the last follow-up. The mean Constant score significantly improved from 40.4 ± 6.7 to 73.3 ± 8.2. A graft tear revealed in 52% (11/21) of overall patients was significantly more frequent in single layer graft when compared to double layer (77% vs 33%, p < 0.05). Location and type of graft tear significantly influenced final outcomes. Patients with a healed (graft continuity with bone at medial and lateral insertion) or medial graft tear showed statistically significant better outcomes when compared with patients in which the graft was completely reabsorbed or torn on humeral side (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction using an acellular porcine dermal xenograft may be a viable alternative to treat massive posterosuperior rotator cuff tear in patients with a painful pseudoparalysis without anterosuperior escape. Structural failure may strongly influence final outcomes with significant role played by tear location.

N2  - Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) exhibits high rates of success and low complication rates. rTSA has undergone numerous design adaptations over recent years, and lateralization of implant components provides theoretical and biomechanical benefits in stability and range of motion (ROM) as well as decreased rates of notching. However, the magnitude of implant lateralization and its effect on these outcomes is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how increasing glenohumeral offset affects outcomes after rTSA, specifically in a lateralized humerus + medialized glenoid implant model. Methods: Primary rTSA using a lateralized humeral + medialized glenoid implant model performed at a single academic institution between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) parameters and clinical outcomes including ROM were evaluated both pre- and postoperatively. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were analyzed for measurement of glenohumeral offset, defined as the acromial-tuberosity offset (ATO) distance on the anteroposterior radiograph. Results: A total of 130 rTSAs were included in the analysis, with a mean follow-up of 35 mo. The mean postoperative absolute ATO was 16 mm, and the mean delta ATO (difference from pre- to postoperatively) was 4.6 mm further lateralized. Among all study patients, improvements in all ROM parameters and all PROs were observed from pre- to postoperative assessments. When assessing for the effects of lateralization on these outcomes, multivariate analysis failed to reveal a significant effect from the absolute postoperative ATO or the delta ATO on any outcome parameter. Conclusions: rTSA using a lateralized humeral + medialized glenoid implant model exhibits excellent clinical outcomes in ROM and PROs. However, the magnitude of lateralization as measured radiographically by the ATO did not significantly affect these outcomes; patients exhibited universally good outcomes irrespective of the degree of offset restoration.

N2  - Background: Several techniques have been described for mobilizing the subscapularis tendon in anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). The purpose of this study was to compare subscapularis tendon healing rates, as determined by ultrasound, in patients following anatomic TSA with either a subscapularis tenotomy or subscapularis peel. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of patients from a previous randomized controlled trial in which patients underwent anatomic TSA and were randomized to either a tenotomy or peel approach. The primary outcome was postoperative tendon healing rates determined on ultrasound at >12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative tendon thickness measured on ultrasound; elbow position (neutral alignment in the belly-press position vs. posterior); internal rotation function measured with the third and fourth questions of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire; and Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder index. Radiographs were analyzed in patients with torn tendons. Results: One hundred patients were randomized to a tenotomy (n = 47) or peel (n = 53) approach. Postoperative ultrasound results were available in 88 patients. Tendon healing rates were 95% for tenotomy vs. 75% for peel (P = .011). The mean postoperative tendon thickness was 4 mm (standard deviation, 1.0 mm) and 4 mm (standard deviation, 1 mm) in the tenotomy and peel groups, respectively (P = .37). Internal rotation function was not associated with healing status (P = .77 and P = .22 for questions 3 and 4, respectively, of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons questionnaire), nor was elbow position (P = .2) in the belly-press position. Discussion: We observed that subscapularis tenotomy had a higher healing rate than peel as determined by ultrasound in TSA patients. There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative tendon thickness in intact tendons as measured on ultrasound when comparing subscapularis mobilization techniques, nor was there any association between healing status and internal rotation function or elbow position.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study is to report a systematic review and meta-analysis of solid organ transplant (SOT) patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty to compare functional and radiographic outcomes, demographics, and complications with non-transplant patients. Methods: Studies were included if they examined patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty in the setting of prior solid organ transplantation and included post operative range of motion, patient-reported outcomes, complications, or revisions. Studies were excluded if they were national database analyses or lacked clinical data. Pubmed, MEDLine, Scopus, and Web of Science were queried using relevant search terms in July 2022. Data was pooled, weighted, and a paired t-test and chi-square analysis was performed. Results: There were 71 SOT and 159 non-SOT shoulders included in the study. The most common indication for surgery was avascular necrosis (n = 26) in the solid organ transplant group and osteoarthritis (n = 60) in the non-SOT group. Forward elevation, external rotation, ASES, and VAS pain scores improved significantly in both cohorts following surgery. There was no significant difference in age at surgery (p-value = 0.20), postoperative forward elevation (p-value = 0.08), postoperative external rotation (0.84), and postoperative ASES scores (p-value = 0.11) between the two cohorts. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the SOT cohort (p-value<0.01). The risk of death was significantly higher in the SOT group (p-value<0.01). but the rate of overall complications (p = 0.47), surgical complication (p-value = 0.79), or revision surgery (p-value = 1.00) was not significantly different between the two cohorts. Conclusion: Shoulder arthroplasty is a safe, effective option in patients following solid organ transplant. There is not an increased risk of adverse outcomes, and SOT patients had comparable range of motion and patient-reported outcomes when compared to their non-SOT peers. Level of evidence: III.

N2  - Background: We aimed to evaluate midterm patient-reported outcomes and reoperation rates following rotator cuff repair in patients with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory arthritis (nonRA-IA) diagnoses. Methods: We identified all patients with either RA or nonRA-IA who underwent a rotator cuff repair at our institution between 2008 and 2018. IA diagnoses included RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and other unspecified inflammatory arthritis. We compiled a cohort of 51 shoulders, with an average follow-up time of 7.0 years. The average age was 60 years (range 39-81), and 55% of patients were female. Patients were contacted via phone to obtain patient-reported outcomes surveys. Univariate linear regression was used to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. Results: A review of preoperative radiographs demonstrated that 50% of patients presented with some degree of glenohumeral joint inflammatory degeneration. At the final follow-up, the mean visual analog score for pain was 2 (range 0-8), and the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) was 77 (standard deviation [SD] = 19). The mean subjective shoulder value was 75% (SD = 22%), and the average satisfaction was 9 (SD 1.9). The mean Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System upper extremity score was 41 (SD = 10.6). Female sex and a complete tear (vs. partial) were both associated with lower ASES scores, whereas no other characteristics were associated with postoperative ASES scores. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimate free of reoperation was 91.8% (95% confidence interval 83.0-99.8). Conclusions: Rotator cuff repair in patients with RA or other inflammatory arthritis diagnoses resulted in satisfactory patient-reported outcomes that seem comparable to rotator cuff repair when performed in the general population. Furthermore, reoperations were rare, with a 5-year survival rate free of reoperation for any reason of over 90%. Altogether, an inflammatory arthritis diagnosis should not preclude by itself attempted rotator cuff repair surgery in these patients.

N2  - To our knowledge, only one previous report described the treatment of osteochondral autograft for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the humeral head (ONHH) in a middle-aged patient. The present report describes a 20-year-old man who was found to have avascular osteonecrosis of the right humeral head after corticosteroid pulse treatment, followed by oral corticosteroid therapy. The patient complained of serious right shoulder pain and limited range of motion (ROM). Anteroposterior (AP) radiographs of the right shoulder revealed a crescent sign at the humeral head, indicating subchondral bone collapse with a linear sclerotic change and normal articular surface of the glenoid. The case was categorized as Stage 3 according to the Cruess classification. In general, Cruess classification Stage 3 is treated with humeral head replacement and shoulder arthroplasty. The patient underwent surgical treatment involving osteochondral autograft transplantation. Autografts were harvested from the right knee. At the 1.5-year follow-up, the patient was pain-free and showed an improved active ROM. Furthermore, AP radiographs demonstrated that the glenohumeral joint space was maintained, and no progression of humeral head collapse was observed. This case may be helpful in decision-making if young patients with ONHH require surgical treatment. Furthermore, osteochondral autograft transplantation may be an effective treatment for ONHH.

N2  - Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a painful and disabling condition with restricted range of motion (ROM) that affects 2% to 3% of the population and up to 20% of patients with diabetes. AC can be idiopathic, iatrogenic, or secondary to shoulder injuries. Some associated conditions include diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, dyslipidemia, stroke, prolonged immobilization, and autoimmune conditions. Management ranges from analgesics to physical therapy, local injections, hydrodilatation, and advanced surgical interventions. This study examines percutaneous coracohumeral ligament (PCHL) sectioning with the hypothesis that interruption would improve pain sand ROM in patients with AC refractory to conservative management. Objectives: To use sonographically guided percutaneous interruption of the CHL for the treatment of refractory AC. Study Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial. Setting: Academic medical center. Methods: Patients were identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. After primary screening, research staff explained the study, risks, and benefits to the patients, and consent was obtained. Patients’ pain score and shoulder ROM were assessed before and after the procedure, at one month, and one year. The Oxford Shoulder Scoring (OSS) questionnaire was also completed before the procedure and in the one-year follow-up visit. Forty patients were enrolled with refractory AC. Forty-six shoulders were treated; 6 patients underwent a bilateral procedure. Block 2:1 randomization was performed for the 2 groups (PCHL release [PCHLR] and local anesthetic CHL [LACHL]). The LACHL group received a lidocaine injection at CHL, and the PCHLR group received the CHL using a Tenex® (Tenex Health, Lake Forest, CA) needle. ROM, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), and OSS were evaluated at baseline, immediate postprocedure, and long term. Results: Among 46 shoulders included in the study, 7 were excluded due to lost to follow-up, total shoulder replacement, and shoulder manipulation. Twenty-six were randomized to the PCHLR group and 13 to LACHL group. ROM (external rotation and abduction), pain, NRS-11 score, and OSS score were measured at baseline and long term, confirmed by a nonbiased health care personnel. There was no statistically significant difference in ROM, NRS-11, and OSS between the 2 cohorts at the baseline visit. Nine patients in LACHL group crossed over to the PCHLR arm at one month. Data analysis in the long term revealed durability of the PCHLR group with a statistically significant difference in ROM, NRS-11, and OSS. External rotation improved by double, and abduction improved by almost 30% (P value < .001). NRS-11 decreased from 8 (IQR 8, 9) at baseline to 3 (IQR 2, 7) at long term among those who received PCHLR. The baseline mean OSS in the PCHLR group increased from 7.44 to 31.86 at one-year follow-up and was statistically significant (P value < .001). Limitations: This study represents a small population of patients with a CHL-related ROM deficit. Patients were not excluded for osteoarthritis or other motion-disabling shoulder conditions. We submit that the strength of the study could have been improved if the physician performing the procedure was blinded and if the patient was blinded as well to minimize operator and patient bias. Conclusions: We demonstrate that our technique for PCHLR is a safe, effective, and durable procedure that improved ROM, pain, and shoulder function in our patient population when compared to the control.

N2  - Background: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is the preferred treatment for glenohumeral arthritis refractory to nonoperative measures. However, some surgeons have argued for a role for hemiarthroplasty (HA) in the setting of a smooth glenoid that articulates appropriately with the humeral head. The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term revision rates and short-term postoperative complications in patients undergoing either HA or TSA for glenohumeral arthritis. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent HA and TSA was conducted using a commercially available national database. Demographics, postoperative complications, risk factors, revision rates, and costs were analyzed using 2 sample t-tests, chi-squared tests, and multivariate logistic regressions. Results: Patients were stratified by operation: (1) HA (n = 1615) or 2) TSA (n = 7845). Patients undergoing primary TSA had higher rates of prior ipsilateral rotator cuff repair and corticosteroid injections. At 2 years, patients who underwent HA, 3.0% of patients had revision surgery, compared to 1.6% of patients who underwent TSA (P =.002); at 5 years, 3.7% of the HA cohort (P <.0001) had revision surgery, compared to 1.9% of patients who underwent TSA. Conclusions: Patients undergoing TSA or RTSA for glenohumeral arthritis had higher preoperative co-morbidities but had no difference in short-term complication rates with a lower risk of revision surgery at both 2-year and 5-year follow-up when compared to HA. Increasing age, female sex, hyperlipidemia, postoperative infection, shoulder instability, and thromboembolism all independently increased odds for revision shoulder arthroplasty for glenohumeral arthritis. Level of evidence: Level: III.

N2  - Patients undergoing planned or unplanned orthopaedic procedures involving their upper or lower extremity can prevent them from safe and timely return to driving, where they commonly ask, ‘Doctor, when can I drive?’ Driving recommendations after such procedures are varied. The current evidence available is based on a heterogenous data set with varying degrees of sample size and markedly differing study designs. This instructional review article provides a scoping overview of studies looking at return to driving after upper or lower extremity surgery in both trauma and elective settings and, where possible, to provide clinical recommendations for return to driving. Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases were searched according to a defined search protocol to elicit eligible studies. Articles were included if they reviewed adult drivers who underwent upper or lower extremity orthopaedic procedures, were written in English, and offered recommendations about driving. A total of 68 articles were included in the analysis, with 36 assessing the lower extremity and 37 reviewing the upper extremity. The evidence available from the studies reviewed was of poor methodological quality. There was a lack of adequately powered, high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes to assess safe return to driving for differing subset of injuries. Many articles provide generic guidelines on return to driving when patients feel safe to perform an emergency stop procedure with adequate steering wheel control. In future, RCTs should be performed to develop definitive return to driving protocols in patients undergoing upper and lower extremity procedures.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to update the Japan College of Rheumatology (JCR) clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and prepare an algorithm for non-drug and surgical treatments. This article is a digest version of the guidelines. Methods: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s research group, in collaboration with the JCR, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method to update the 2014 JCR CPG for RA. The consensus was formed by CPG panel members. Results: We raised 19 clinical questions regarding non-drug and surgical treatments for RA and developed recommendations. The treatments included exercise therapy; occupational therapy; joint injection of corticosteroids; and orthopaedic surgeries including cervical spine surgery, wrist and foot arthroplasty, ankle arthrodesis, and replacement arthroplasty of the shoulder, elbow, finger, hip, knee, and ankle. Recommendations regarding the risks of surgery and perioperative discontinuation of medications have also been developed. Based on these recommendations, we created an original algorithm for the non-drug and surgical treatment of RA. Conclusions: These recommendations are expected to serve rheumatologists, health care professionals, and patients with RA as tools for shared decision-making to treat residual limb joint symptoms and functional impairment.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Golf is a sport that can be played by an athlete of any age, which enhances its popularity. Each golfer’s swing is unique, and there is no “right” way to swing the golf club; however, the professional golfer often has more of a consistent swing as opposed to an amateur golfer. A collaborative, team approach involving the golfer with a swing coach, physical therapist, and physician often can be informative on how to prevent golf injury, but also how to treat golf injury if it occurs. Recent Findings: As a rotational sport, the golfer needs to be trained and treated with respect for how the body works as a linkage system or kinetic chain. A warm-up is recommended for every golfer before practicing or playing, and this warm-up should account for every segment of the linkage system. Though it has been thought of as a relatively safe sport, injuries can be seen with golfers of any age or skill level, and upper body injuries involving the cervical and thoracic spine, shoulder, elbow, and wrist are common. Summary: A narrative review is provided here of the epidemiology of golf injury and common injuries involving each of these upper body regions. In addition, treatment and injury prevention recommendations are discussed.

N2  - Background: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint cysts are relatively rare. There are two distinct etiologies of AC cysts. Type 1 is isolated to the AC joint, while type 2, is related to a tear or rupture of the rotator cuff (RC). The disease is usually a rare result of advanced AC joint arthritis or RC-tear arthropathy. Patients may present with signs and symptoms of RC impingement and tear. Conservative management may be used initially in asymptomatic individuals who are also not concerned with cosmesis. Aspiration and steroid injection of the cyst has been reported as one method of non-surgical management of these lesions, however, there is a high rate of recurrence. Case Presentation: We report a case of A 72-year-old right-handed female with past medical history of type two diabetes mellitus, chronic smoking, and a prior right RC repair with distal clavicle resection who presented with an AC joint cyst complicated by a draining fistula as a result of cyst aspiration and steroid injection. Due to the persistent drainage of the cyst and concern for infection, the patient was treated with a staged reverse shoulder arthroplasty given the setting of an irreparable rotator cuff tear and end-stage cuff-tear arthropathy. Conclusion: This case demonstrates an important complication of persistent draining fistula resulting from AC joint cyst aspiration and steroid injection in the setting of advanced RC-tear arthropathy. In immunocompromised patients, staged reverse shoulder arthroplasty should be considered for treatment of these draining fistulas especially when the concern for periprosthetic infection is high.

N2  - Background: A scarcity of literature exists comparing outcomes of outpatient anatomic (aTSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA). This study was performed to compare early outcomes between the 2 procedures in a freestanding ambulatory surgery center (ASC) and to determine if the addition of preoperative interscalene nerve block (ISNB) with periarticular liposomal bupivacaine injection (PAI) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) would improve outcomes over PAI alone. Methods: Medical charts of all patients undergoing outpatient primary aTSA or rTSA at 2 ASCs from 2012 to 2020 were reviewed. A total of 198 patients were ultimately identified (117 aTSA and 81 rTSA) to make up this retrospective cohort study. Patient demographics, PACU outcomes, complications, readmissions, reoperations, calls to the office, and unplanned clinic visit rates were compared between procedures. PACU outcomes were compared between those receiving ISNB with PAI and those receiving PAI alone. Results: Patients undergoing rTSA were older (61.1 vs. 55.7 years, P <.001) and more likely to have American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3 (51.9% vs. 41.0%, P =.050) compared to patients having aTSA. No patient required an overnight stay. Time in the PACU before discharge (89.1 vs. 95.6 minutes, P =.231) and pain scores at discharge (3.0 vs. 3.0, P =.815) were similar for aTSA and rTSA, respectively. One intraoperative complication occurred in the aTSA group (posterior humeral circumflex artery injury) and 1 in the rTSA group (calcar fracture) (P =.793). Ninety-day postoperative total complication (7.7% vs. 7.4%), shoulder-related complication (6.0% vs. 6.2%), medical-related complication (1.7% vs. 1.2%), admission (0.8% vs. 2.5%), reoperation (2.6% vs. 1.2%), and unplanned clinic visit (6.0% vs. 6.1%) rates were similar between aTSA and rTSA, respectively (P ≥.361 for all comparisons). At 1 year, there were 8 reoperations and 15 complications in the aTSA group compared with 1 reoperation and 8 complications in the rTSA group (P =.091 and P =.818, respectively). Patients who had ISNB spent less time in PACU (75 vs. 97 minutes, P <.001), had less pain at discharge (0.2 vs. 3.9, P <.001), and consumed less oral morphine equivalents in the PACU (1.2 vs. 16.6 mg, P <.001). Conclusion: Early postoperative outcomes and complication rates were similar between the 2 groups, and all patients were successfully discharged home the day of surgery. The addition of preoperative ISNB led to more efficient discharge from the ASC with less pain in the PACU.

N2  - Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe the use of ultrasound for the diagnosis and treatment of painful joint arthroplasty. Ultrasound plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of the painful joint arthroplasty, especially given its unique dynamic capabilities, convenience, and high resolution. Ultrasound guidance is also instrumental for procedures in both diagnosing and in select cases, treating the painful joint arthroplasty. Topics to be discussed in this article include trends in arthroplasty placement, benefits of the use of ultrasound overall, and ultrasound evaluation of periprosthetic joint infections. We will also review the sonographic findings with dissociated/displaced components and adverse reaction to metallic debris including metallosis, trunnionosis, and metal-on-metal pseudotumors. Additionally, we will discuss ultrasound evaluation of tendon pathologies with arthroplasties, including dynamic maneuvers to evaluate for tendon impingement/snapping. Finally, we will cover ultrasound-guided joint arthroplasty injection indications and precautions. Key points: • Ultrasound is preferred over MRI in patients with joint arthroplasty and plays a crucial role in diagnosis, especially given its unique dynamic capabilities, convenience and high resolution. • It is especially beneficial for US-guided aspiration in periprosthetic joint infections; effectively used to evaluate periprosthetic fluid collections, facilitating differentiation between abscesses and aseptic collections, and tracking sinus tracts. • Recently, the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections has shifted focus to biomarkers in the periprosthetic fluid, specifically α‐defensin, which has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing infection. • Cutibacterium acnes is a major pathogen responsible for shoulder arthroplasty infections, often presenting with normal laboratory values and since slow growing, must be kept for a minimum of 14 days.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between preoperative platelet counts and postoperative complication rates within 30 days of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database was queried for all patients who underwent TSA between 2015 and 2019. The study population was then divided into 5 groups based on their preoperative platelet count: <100k (moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia), 100-150k (mild thrombocytopenia), 150-200k (low-normal preoperative platelet count), 200-450k (normal, reference cohort), and >450k (thrombocytosis). Postoperative complications within 30 days of the TSA were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between preoperative platelet counts and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 19,721 patients undergoing TSA between 2015 and 2019 were included in this study. One hundred fifty-five patients (0.8%) had moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia, 982 (5.0%) had mild thrombocytopenia, 3945 (20.0%) had a low-normal preoperative platelet count, 14,386 (72.9%) had a normal preoperative platelet count, and 253 (1.3%) had thrombocytosis. An increasing rate of overall complications was observed as the severity of thrombocytopenia progressed from low-normal (6.4%) to mild thrombocytopenia (10.2%) and to moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia (18.7%). The overall complication rate of the thrombocytosis cohort was 14.6%. In comparison to normal platelet count, low-normal thrombocytopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia, and thrombocytosis were identified by multivariate analysis as significant predictors of overall complications (odds ratios [ORs] of 1.12, 2.15, 2.43, 2.71, respectively), postoperative anemia requiring transfusion (ORs of 1.63, 3.45, 5.97, 4.21, respectively), and minor complications (ORs of 1.39, 2.64, 3.40, 3.34, respectively). Minor complications include progressive renal insufficiency, urinary tract infection, transfusions within 72 hours after surgery, pneumonia, and superficial incisional surgical site infection. Conclusion: Increasing severity of thrombocytopenia correlated with higher overall postoperative complication rates following TSA. Interestingly, patients with thrombocytosis had the highest overall postoperative complication rates among all cohorts included in this study. Platelet counts are often the reflection of other comorbidities and a good indicator of patient's general health status. Long-term optimization of abnormal platelet counts may potentially reduce surgical complications.

N2  - Introduction/Purpose: Tranexamic acid (TXA) use is increasing in orthopaedic practice specially among arthroplasty surgeons. It was proven to decrease the estimated blood loss and need for blood transfusion in hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty as well as pelvis and acetabulum surgery. There was no reported increased risk of thromboembolic events with the use of TXA in orthopaedic practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed on reporting on the available evidence on the use of TXA in foot and ankle surgery. Methods: The current meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic-based search on MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases to November 2021. Clinical studies on tranexamic acid use in foot and ankle surgeries reporting at least one of the desired outcomes, estimated blood loss (EBL), hemoglobin difference between pre- and postoperation, or complications were included. To assess risk of bias, the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool was used for case series and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for comparative studies. The level of evidence was assigned according to the Cochrane Book Review Group. Results: A total of 718 foot and ankle procedures were included. Out of those, 491 (68.38%) procedures received tranexamic acid whereas 221 (31.64%) served as controls and did not receive tranexamic acid. In the TXA group, 34 (6.92%) procedures received local TXA injection in one study, whereas the remaining majority of 457 (93.08%) procedures received intravenous (IV) TXA. Among the control group, saline was used a placebo in 113 (51.13%) controls in 3 studies, whereas no placebo was used in the remaining 108 (48.87%) controls. The pooled mean EBL for the TXA group was 57.75 mL (95% CI 44.80-70.70, I2 = 98.31%), whereas the pooled mean EBL for the control group was 299.26 mL (95% CI 212.43-386.09, I2 = 98.96%) with statistical significance (Figure 1). No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of change of hemoglobin and risk of thromboembolic events and other complications (Figures 2 and 3). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the use of TXA in foot and ankle surgery was safe with no increased risk in thromboembolic events. The lower risk of bleeding using TXA, despite being statistically significant, did not reach clinical significance and did not affect the postoperative hemoglobin level. TXA can be considered in foot and ankle surgery in special cases with higher risk of bleeding or in cases where the use of tourniquet is contraindicated. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction Interscalene brachial plexus blocks are a commonly performed procedure to reduce pain following total shoulder arthroplasty. Liposomal bupivacaine has been purported to prolong the duration of brachial plexus blocks for up to 72 hours; however, there has been controversy surrounding the analgesic benefits of this drug. Our hypothesis was that an interscalene block performed with bupivacaine alone would be non-inferior to a combination of liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine with respect to opioid consumption following total shoulder arthroplasty. Methods Subjects presenting for primary total shoulder arthroplasty were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an ultrasound-guided, single-injection interscalene block with either a combination of liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine (LB group) or bupivacaine without additive (Bupi group). The primary outcome of this study was 72-hour postoperative cumulative opioid consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) with a non-inferiority margin of 22.5 mg. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, patient satisfaction with analgesia and patient reported duration of sensory block. Results Seventy-six subjects, 38 from the Bupi group and 38 from the LB group, completed the study. Analysis of the primary outcome showed a 72-hour cumulative geometric mean oral morphine equivalent consumption difference of 11.9 mg (95% CI -6.9 to 30.8) between groups (calculated on the log scale). This difference constitutes approximately 1.5 tablets of oxycodone over 3 days. No secondary outcomes showed meaningful differences between groups. Discussion Interscalene brachial plexus blocks performed with bupivacaine alone did not demonstrate non-inferiority compared to a mixture of liposomal bupivacaine plus bupivacaine with regards to 72-hour cumulative opioid consumption following total shoulder arthroplasty. However, the difference between groups did not appear to be clinically meaningful.

N2  - Bisphosphonates are the first-line pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis due to their efficacy and low rate of self-limited adverse effects. Challenges in adherence to oral treatment has spurred the development of third-generation bisphosphonates that only require single annual infusion due to high potency and binding efficacy. The authors report the case of a woman in her 70s who presented with postoperative shoulder pain after zoledronic acid infusion. Diagnostic work-up revealed stable prosthesis with no signs of fracture, loosening or infection. Administration of oral steroids resulted in resolution of pain and return to baseline function. Acute postoperative joint pain attributed to bisphosphonate infusion has not been previously described in the literature. This case report and literature review suggests consideration of adverse inflammatory reaction due to bisphosphonate infusion in the setting of a patient presenting with joint replacement and acute exacerbation of pain without clear aetiology.

N2  - Background:While providing effective analgesia following shoulder arthroplasty, an interscalene block has known complications. Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) using ropivacaine has been successfully employed in other joint arthroplasties, but its efficacy in shoulder arthroplasty has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to compare pain and opioid consumption between LIA and an interscalene block following shoulder arthroplasty.Methods:Patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: the block group received an interscalene block using liposomal bupivacaine, and the injection group received an LIA injection intraoperatively. The LIA injection included ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and normal saline solution. Postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalents, and complications were compared between the groups. The mean pain scores during the first 24 hours postoperatively were used to test noninferiority of LIA compared with an interscalene block.Results:The study included 74 patients (52 men and 22 women with a mean age of 69 years; 37 were in the injection group and 37 in the block group). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to pain scores at any postoperative time points (p > 0.05), except for the 8-hour time point, when the injection group had a significantly higher pain score than the block group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in opioid consumption between the groups at any time points postoperatively (p > 0.05). The amount of intraoperative opioid consumption was significantly higher in the injection group (p < 0.001). In noninferiority testing for the mean pain scores during the first 24 hours, the injection group was found to be noninferior to the block group. One patient in the block group developed transient phrenic nerve palsy. One patient in the injection group developed dislocation after reverse arthroplasty related to noncompliance. The mean procedure hospital charge was $1,718 for an interscalene block and $157 for LIA.Conclusions:LIA and an interscalene block provided similar analgesia during the first 24 hours after primary shoulder arthroplasty. LIA was associated with worse pain at 8 hours postoperatively and more intraoperative opioid consumption but was also substantially less costly.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level I.

N2  - Although the suppression of physiological responses to the balance between nociception caused by surgical trauma and anti-nociception due to anesthesia during total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is relevant for better perioperative managements, quantitative evaluations of the effects of ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) on physiological responses have not been performed. Physiological responses were assessed using the nociceptive response (NR) index. In this multi-institutional observational study, associations between ISB and NR values were examined among inpatients undergoing TSA under general anesthesia between March 2019 and January 2021. The effects of ISB on acute postoperative pain and major complications within 30 days after surgery were also examined. NR values after skin incision clearly showed significant suppressions of physiological responses in patients undergoing TSA with ISB (n = 60), compared to those without ISB (n = 24). Acute postoperative pain on the day of surgery was also significantly less in patients with ISB than in those without ISB. Postoperative complications, classified by Clavien-Dindo grades, showed no significant differences between patients with and without ISB. A propensity score-matched sensitivity analysis confirmed the same results in patients with (n = 21) and without ISB (n = 21). In conclusion, suppression of physiological responses to the balance between nociception and anti-nociception by ISB can be quantitatively evaluated by NR index during TSA.

N2  - Purpose of reviewTotal shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is growing in popularity and is increasingly done on an ambulatory basis. This review examines recent developments in anesthesia and analgesia for ambulatory shoulder surgery. Pathway components are discussed and a sample pathway is described.Recent FindingsAdoption of pathways for shoulder surgery improves patient experience by reducing pain, opioid use, and side effects while improving patient satisfaction. Long-acting nerve blockade using adjuvants like dexamethasone provide long-lasting analgesia without rebound pain. Peripheral nerve blockade provides better analgesia than peri-articular injection of local anesthetic. There are multiple approaches to nerve blockade for shoulder surgery to consider, including interscalene, superior trunk, supraclavicular, and anterior suprascapular nerve blocks. Multimodal analgesia should include acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but routine gabapentinoids should not be used.SummaryAnesthesiologists should lead the way to create and implement pathways for ambulatory total shoulder arthroplasty, incorporating appropriate patient selection, patient education, long-lasting nerve blockade, and multimodal analgesia.

N2  - Background: The opioid epidemic has become a central focus in health care. In an effort to reduce opioid use, orthopedic surgeons use multimodal strategies to control postoperative pain. However, no clear consensus exists on ideal pain management strategies after shoulder arthroplasty, and most protocols are opioid-driven. This study sought to determine if patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty using a postoperative opioid-sparing pain-control regimen would have equivalent pain scores and satisfaction as patients using a traditional opioid-based regimen. Methods: Patients undergoing primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled and randomized into an opioid-sparing (OS) or a traditional opioid-based (OB) postoperative pain protocol. Both groups received opioid education, periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine, and preoperative and postoperative multimodal management (acetaminophen, celecoxib, and gabapentin). The OB group was discharged with 40 oxycodone tablets and standard icing, whereas the OS group received ketorolac during admission, continuous cryotherapy, and discharged with 10 oxycodone tablets for rescue. Patients were queried regarding levels of pain and opioid consumption at days 1-7 and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was recorded at 1, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), and Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) scores were assessed preoperatively and at 12 weeks postoperatively. Complications, readmissions, and reoperations were recorded. Results: In 78 patients, no difference in VAS pain scores were seen at any time between groups. The OS group consumed less oral morphine equivalents (OME) from inpatient hospitalization to 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05). Total OME consumption was reduced by 213% for the OS vs. the OB group (112 vs. 239; P < .0001). The OS group consumed fewer opioid pills at all time points (P < .05). A 395% reduction in number of opioid pills consumed in the first 12 weeks postoperatively was seen in the OS vs. the OB group (4.3 vs. 17.0; P < .0001). Significantly more patients in the OS group discontinued opioids by 2 weeks postoperatively (86.1% vs. 58.5%; P = .011), and 94.4% in the OS group discontinued opioids by 6 weeks postoperatively. The OS group was more satisfied with pain management at 1 and 6 weeks (P = .05). No difference in ROM, ASES or SANE scores, complications, readmissions, or reoperations were seen between groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a nearly 4-fold reduction in opioid pain pill consumption and earlier cessation of opioids with an OS pain management protocol. Patients also reported higher satisfaction with this pain management strategy.

N2  - Background: Thousands of orthopedic surgeons in the United State face medical malpractice claims annually; however, little is known regarding the common causes for litigation against shoulder surgeons. In addition, the current analysis does not take into consideration how surgical frequency affects the litigation likelihood. The purpose of our investigation was to identify the most common causes of litigation against shoulder surgeons in the United States adjusting for surgical frequency. Methods: The VerdictSearch database was used using the search terms “medical malpractice,” “shoulder,” and “NOT cancer.” Results were queried, and all studies pertaining to orthopedic shoulder surgery included. Data gathered included cause of lawsuit, indemnity paid, type of surgery performed, results of the cases, verdict or settlement, and, if applicable, technical error. A query of a multisurgeon institutional database was conducted to determine how frequently surgeries were performed. Then the frequency of litigation was adjusted by the procedure frequency to determine which surgery has the greatest likelihood to be litigated relative to rotator cuff surgery. Results: Forty-five cases were included in our study. After adjusting for the procedure frequency, the most likely procedure to be litigated, relative to rotator cuff repair, was manipulation under anesthesia (MUA), 251 times more likely to be litigated, and washout/lavage procedures, 17 times more likely to be litigated. Injection and total shoulder arthroplasty were 23 and 14 times less likely to be litigated relative to rotator cuff repair, respectively. In addition, the average age of the patients was 47 years, and 53% of the cases involved a male plaintiff. The most commonly litigated procedures were rotator cuff repair (42%), MUA (13%), and humeral open reduction and internal fixation (9%). The most commonly cited symptoms for litigation against shoulder surgeons were pain (60%) and loss of range of motion (40%). Of the 45 cases, 44% ended in physician loss, with the average indemnity paid via verdict being $1,118,714 vs. $416,875 for settlement. Conclusions: This study identifies that MUA and lavage/washout procedures are much more likely to be litigated relative to rotator cuff repair. Rotator cuff repair is actually one of the least likely procedures to be litigated. Furthermore, settlement may represent a method of decreasing the indemnity paid for malpractice cases for which surgeons are implicated.

N2  - Case:We present a 58-year-old left hand-dominant woman with right glenohumeral osteoarthritis and anterior instability in the setting of a congenital residual limb at the level of the mid-humerus. She had persistent pain and dysfunction despite trying conservative treatments and elected for a stemless or "canal-sparing" hemiarthroplasty with anterior capsular reconstruction. At the 2-year follow-up, there was significant improvement in her pain, motion, and function without signs of radiographic loosening.Conclusion:A stemless humeral implant is a versatile component that can be used in the face of humeral dysplasia, such as this patient with a congenital residual limb.

N2  - Background: Radiation therapy has proven efficacy for cancer treatment but is not without short- and long-term side effects, including radiation-induced lymphedema. There has been limited evidence on the secondary effects of prior radiation therapy on shoulder surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term outcomes of shoulder arthroplasty and rotator cuff repair (RCR) in patients who have undergone ipsilateral radiation therapy and/or have preoperative upper extremity lymphedema. Methods: Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer was used to query for patients who underwent RCR at our institution. Patients with radiation therapy for breast or lung cancer prior to ipsilateral RCR or shoulder arthroplasty were included. Patients with less than 2 years of follow-up were excluded. Data variables included primary tumor type, dates of cancer diagnoses, radiation treatment, axillary lymph node dissection (aLND), presence of lymphedema, index shoulder operations, most recent follow-up, and surgical and medical complications within the 90-day postoperative period. Additional oncologic variables included total Gray (Gy) delivered. Results: Twenty-one patients underwent radiation therapy and subsequent shoulder arthroplasty or RCR (13 RCR, 3 total shoulder arthroplasty, 5 reverse shoulder arthroplasty). There were 20 females and 1 male with an average age of 65.6 years (47-82) and average clinical follow-up of 4.4 years (2.0-7.4). Oncologic diagnoses included lung (4.8%) and breast (95.2%) cancer. Average radiation dose delivered was 53.3 Gy (38.5-64) in the cohort. The average time from last external beam radiation therapy to shoulder surgery was 4.3 years (0.3-18.0). One of 13 (7.7%) 90-day postoperative complications was reported in the RCR cohort: a superficial vein thrombosis. One of 8 (12.5%) 90-day complications was reported in the arthroplasty cohort: a clinically suspected but radiographically absent acromial stress fracture in a reverse shoulder arthroplasty that did not require operative intervention. Overall, there were no revisions, reoperations, or shoulder-related unplanned inpatient 90-day readmissions. Among 10 patients with prior aLND, 3 (30%) (2 RCR, 1 arthroplasty) experienced new or worsening upper extremity lymphedema within the immediate postoperative period. Conclusion: A minority of patients having undergone prior radiation therapy and aLND who subsequently underwent ipsilateral shoulder surgery experienced worsening subjective upper extremity lymphedema. Although 10% of these radiation therapy patients experienced minor complications within 90 days of their shoulder surgery, none were severe enough to merit inpatient admission or revision surgery.

N2  - Background: Degenerative arthritis is a major indication for both anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Degenerative arthritis is an age-related process that can be secondary to mechanical wear or inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Management of these diseases can include chronic corticosteroid for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Given the well-known complications of chronic steroid use on other surgical procedures, investigation into postoperative complications specific to TSA will assist physicians in risk stratification and preoperative planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between chronic preoperative steroid use and postoperative complications following TSA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database was queried for all patients who underwent TSA between 2015 and 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical characteristics, and 30-day postoperative complication data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify postoperative complications associated with chronic preoperative steroid use. Reasons and risk factors for readmission among chronic steroid users were subsequently identified, as well. Results: A total of 26,669 patients were included in this study: 25,376 (95.2%) were included in the nonsteroid cohort and 1293 (4.8%) were included in the chronic steroid cohort. The postoperative complications that were significantly associated with chronic preoperative steroid use were septic shock (P = .007), urinary tract infection (P = .016), myocardial infarction (P = .022), ventilator >48 hours (P = .028), readmission (P < .001), nonhome discharge (P < .001), and mortality (P = .007). The only postoperative complication independently associated with chronic preoperative steroid use was readmission (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.79; P = .027). Conclusion: Preoperative chronic steroid use is an independent predictor for readmission following TSA. As procedural improvement increases surgical volume for TSA, a better understanding of preoperative risk factors can improve perioperative risk stratification and help to minimize adverse outcomes.

N2  - Background and hypothesis: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery is one of the most common shoulder procedures performed in the United States. Although several studies have shown considerable symptomatic relief in the short term following surgery, a relatively high rate of recurrent defects has led surgeons to question the long-term durability of this operation. We hypothesized that outcomes at a minimum of 15 years of follow-up in patients who underwent all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair would be maintained and would remain significantly improved compared with the preoperative status. Methods: All-arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs were performed in 193 patients from 2003 to 2005. Patient-reported outcomes were collected preoperatively and at 1, 2, 5, and ≥15 years postoperatively. The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Shoulder Activity Scale (SAS), visual analog scale, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)–Upper Extremity (UE) scores. Patient demographic characteristics, revision surgical procedures, and complications were recorded. Generalized estimating equations were used to model scores over time, and multiple comparisons between time points were performed using Tukey adjustment. Results: This study included 60 patients with a mean follow-up period of 16.5 years (range, 15.8-17.7 years). The mean ASES score improved from 60.2 ± 18.8 preoperatively to 93.0 ± 9.4 at ≥15 years (P < .0001). The mean visual analog scale pain score decreased from 4.1 ± 0.7 preoperatively to 0.7 ± 0.3 at ≥15 years (P < .0001). The average SANE, SAS, and PROMIS-UE scores at ≥15 years were 87.8 ± 14.8, 8.8 ± 4.3, and 49.6 ± 10.2, respectively. Of 60 patients, 7 underwent revision surgery. Older age and female sex were associated with lower SAS scores at 15 years, whereas female sex was associated with lower PROMIS-UE scores. There were no factors predictive of ASES or SANE scores. Conclusion: At long-term follow-up (≥15 years), the patient-reported outcomes of all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair show significant improvement from baseline preoperative function and remain durable over a period of 15 years. This information is useful in counseling patients regarding the long-term results of this procedure.

N2  - Introduction: Osteoporosis is highly prevalent in elective orthopedic surgery. While preoperative bone health optimization decreases osteoporosis-related complications, there is an unmet need to establish who may benefit from preoperative dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study assesses a novel, simple screening protocol to identify orthopedic surgical patients for preoperative DXA. Materials/Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 628 patients undergoing total knee, hip, or shoulder arthroplasty or thoracolumbar spine fusion. Inclusion criteria were ≥40 years undergoing primary elective surgery. Screening criteria defining who should obtain DXA due to high osteoporosis risk included: female ≥65, male ≥70, fracture history when ≥50 years, or FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk (without bone mineral density [BMD]-adjustments) ≥8.4%. Osteoporosis was defined by World Health Organization criteria [T-score ≤ −2.5], clinical National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) criteria [T-score ≤ −2.5, elevated BMD-adjusted FRAX risk, or prior hip/spine fracture], and modified clinical criteria [NOF criteria simplified to include any non-traumatic prior fracture and FRAX without BMD]. Results: The study included 100 TKAs, 100 THAs, 251 TSAs, and 177 spine fusions, average age 65.6 ± 9.8. DXA was available for 209 patients. Screening criteria recommending DXA was met by 362 patients. For those with DXA, screening sensitivity was.96 (CI:.78 to.99) and specificity was.19 (CI:.14 to.25) for identifying T-score osteoporosis. Similar sensitivity of.99 (CI:.91 to.99) and specificity of.61 (CI:.56 to.66) were found for modified clinical osteoporosis. For modified clinical osteoporosis, 192 patients with osteoporosis met criteria (true pos.), 1 patient with osteoporosis did not meet criteria (false neg.), 170 patients without osteoporosis met criteria (false pos.), and 265 patients without osteoporosis did not meet criteria (true neg.). Discussion/Conclusion: A simple screening protocol identifies orthopedic surgical candidates at risk of T-score or clinical osteoporosis for preoperative DXA with high sensitivity.

N2  - Background: Opiate-based regimens have been used as a foundation of postoperative analgesia in orthopedic surgery for decades, and the vast majority of orthopedic patients in the United States receive postoperative opioid prescriptions. Both the safety and efficacy of opioid use in orthopedic patients have been questioned because of mounting evidence that postoperative opioid use can be detrimental to outcomes and patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to compare a new, opioid-free pain management pathway with a traditional opioid-containing, multimodal pathway in patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: This is a single-center randomized clinical trial in which 67 patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty were allocated into 2 treatment arms: either a completely opioid-free, multimodal perioperative pain management pathway (OF), or a traditional opioid-containing perioperative pain management pathway (OC). Pain was measured on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 at 6-, 12-, 24-hour, 2-week, and 6-week time points. Deviations from the OF pathway, morphine milligram equivalents, readmissions, and opioid-related side effects were analyzed. Results: Pain levels were significantly lower in the OF group at 12 hours, 24 hours, and 2 weeks. At 12 hours, the median pain rating was 0 compared with a median pain rating of 3 in the OC group (P =.003). At 24 hours, the OF group reported a median pain rating of 1 and the OC group reported a median pain rating of 4 (P <.001). The median pain rating at the 2-week time point in the OF group was 2 compared with 4 in the OC group (P =.006). Median pain ratings were similar between the OF group and the OC group at the 6-week time point. The median pain rating in the OF group at 6 weeks was 1, compared with 1.5 in the OC group. Of the 35 patients in the OF pathway, 1 required a rescue opioid medication for left cervical radiculopathy that ultimately necessitated cervical spine fusion after recovery from right shoulder arthroplasty, and 1 was noted to have taken an opioid medication, diverted from a prior prescription, at the 2-week visit. The morphine milliequivalents received in the OF group was 20 compared with 4936.25 in the OC group. There were no readmissions in the OF pathway, and no differences between the groups with regard to constipation, falls, or delirium. Conclusion: A multimodal, opioid-free perioperative pain management pathway is safe and effective in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty and offers superior pain relief to that of a traditional opioid-containing pain management pathway at 12 hours, 24 hours, and 2 weeks postoperatively.

N2  - Background and hypothesis: Transitioning shoulder arthroplasty (SA) from an inpatient to outpatient procedure is associated with increased patient satisfaction and potentially decreased costs; however, concerns exist about complications following same-day discharge. We hypothesized that outpatient SA would be associated with low rates of failed discharges, readmissions, and complications, rendering it a safe and effective option for SA. Methods: A systematic review of the outpatient SA literature identified 16 of 447 studies with level III and IV evidence that met the inclusion criteria with at least 90 days of follow-up. Data on patient demographic characteristics, preoperative and postoperative protocols, surgery characteristics, failed discharges, complications, and readmissions were collected and pooled for analysis. Results: A total of 990 patients were included in our analysis. Many studies identified specific institutional protocols for determining eligibility for outpatient SA, including preoperative clearance from an anesthesiologist; identification of a perioperative caretaker; and exclusion of patients based on cardiac, pulmonary, or hematologic risk factors. Failed same-day discharge occurred in only 0.9% of patients (7 of 788), and 2.1% of patients (9 of 418) and 0.79% of patients (2 of 252) presented to an emergency department or urgent care facility for a perioperative concern. The readmission rate for periprosthetic fracture, arthrofibrosis, infection, subscapularis rupture, and anterior subluxation was 1.3% (7 of 529 patients). Complications occurred in 7.0% of patients (70 of 990), with 5.4% of patients (53 of 990) experiencing a surgical complication and 1.7% (17 of 990) having a medical complication. There were 28 total reoperations (2.9%, 28 of 955 patients). Discussion and conclusion: Outpatient SA is associated with low rates of failed discharges, readmissions, and complications. Additionally, the medical and surgical complications that occur after outpatient SA are unlikely to be prevented by the short inpatient stay characteristic of traditional SA. With careful screening measures to identify appropriate candidates for same-day discharge, outpatient SA represents a safe approach to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and to decrease costs associated with SA.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are widely used as a management modality for mild large joint osteoarthritis (OA). In contrast, there is little guidance or consensus on the use of steroids in moderate to severe disease. The aim of this study is to explore the current practice of surgeons in relation to the use of therapeutic intra-articular steroid injections in patients awaiting large joint arthroplasty for OA. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to consultants performing large joint arthroplasty in four National Health Service Trusts. Participants were questioned on their use of intra-articular therapeutic steroid injections in patients listed for elbow, shoulder, hip or knee arthroplasty. Data was collected over 6 months and analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: A total of 42 surgeons were included in the study with the majority performing lower limb arthroplasty (73%). About 21 (50%) surgeons indicated they would perform injections in the patient group of interest. Two would perform an unlimited number of injections, whilst the remainder would perform between one and three injections. Respondents most commonly indicated they would tell patients that an injection would provide between 6 and 12 weeks of benefit (14 of 39 surgeons, 36%). Most injecting surgeons (88%) leave 4 months between an injection and subsequent arthroplasty due to increased risk of infection if surgery is performed sooner. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates variation in practice in the use of intra-articular steroids in the analysed patient group, and the way surgeons council their patients. National or specialist society guidelines may help to reduce this variation in practice.

N2  - Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare and potentially fatal multisystem drug hypersensitivity reaction. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 1,000-10,000 drug exposures, of which 70% are estimated to have liver involvement. Mortality is estimated to be 10%, and fulminant liver failure is the most common cause of death. Many drugs have been linked to DRESS, but anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and allopurinol, are the most commonly cited culprits. Recent studies have demonstrated that increased use of antibiotics in hospitalized patients has led to an increase in antibioticassociated DRESS. We are reporting a rare case of DRESS syndrome with acute severe hepatitis from Vancomycin. Our patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, anxiety, and left shoulder arthroplasty who presented to ED with fever, poor appetite/decreased PO intake and generalized rash. He was undergoing outpatient treatment with IV Vancomycin for prosthetic left shoulder Corynebacterium and Cutibacterium infection. Vancomycin was started three weeks prior to presentation to ED. The rash was non-itchy and non-painful, described as juicy erythematous macules coalescing into edematous plaques without mucositis. Initial labs showed AKI with creatinine 2.4 mg/ dL (baseline 1.1), thrombocytopenia (104 x103/uL), hyponatremia (132 mmol/L), hypokalemia (3.3 mmol/L), and hypophosphatemia (1.6 mmol/L). He was found to have acute liver injury (AST 8685 IU/L, ALT 5450 IU/L, T bili 4.1 mg/dL, D bili 2.5 mg/dL, ALP 154 IU/L, and GGT 226 IU/L & INR 2.4) for which Hepatology was consulted. Vitals revealed fever of 104°F, HR 139, RR 39, BP 163/102, and O2 sat 99%. Physical exam showed diffuse rash spreading cephalocaudally, fever, and bilateral lymphadenopathy with tenderness of anterior cervical chain. He was admitted for sepsis with acute liver and kidney injury. The antibiotic regimen was broadened to daptomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Vancomycin was stopped. Extensive liver workup was unremarkable. Liver transplant evaluation was initiated for impending acute liver failure. Skin biopsy was performed for diffuse morbilliform eruption with over 50% body surface area involvement and a presumed diagnosis of DRESS. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and methylprednisolone were started with a provisional diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Liver biopsy showed severe acute hepatitis with mild cholestasis compatible with DILI. Skin biopsy showed subtle vacuolar interface dermatitis compatible with DRESS. INR and LFTs improved quickly with the initiation of steroids. After an inpatient stay of 22 days, the patient was discharged on steroid taper. The patient was advised to avoid re-challenge with Vancomycin as there is a significant risk of recurrence of DRESS if re-exposed. (Figure Presented)

N2  - Aims Corticosteroid injections are often used to manage glenohumeral arthritis in patients who may be candidates for future total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) or reverse shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA). In the conservative management of these patients, corticosteroid injections are often provided for symptomatic relief. The purpose of this study was to determine if the timing of corticosteroid injections prior to TSA or rTSA is associated with changes in rates of revision and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following these procedures. Methods data were collected from a national insurance database from January 2006 to december 2017. Patients who underwent shoulder corticosteroid injection within one year prior to ipsilateral TSA or rTSA were identified and stratified into the following cohorts: < three months, three to six months, six to nine months, and nine to 12 months from time of corticosteroid injection to TSA or rTSA. A control cohort with no corticosteroid injection within one year prior to TSA or rTSA was used for comparison. univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between specific time intervals and outcomes. results In total, 4,252 patients were included in this study. Among those, 1,632 patients (38.4%) received corticosteroid injection(s) within one year prior to TSA or rTSA and 2,620 patients (61.6%) did not. On multivariate analysis, patients who received corticosteroid injection < three months prior to TSA or rTSA were at significantly increased risk for revision (odds ratio (OR) 2.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77 to 3.28); p < 0.001) when compared with the control cohort. However, there was no significant increase in revision risk for all other timing interval cohorts. Notably, Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥ 3 was a significant independent risk factor for all-cause revision (OR 4.00 (95% CI 1.40 to 8.92); p = 0.036). Conclusion There is a time-dependent relationship between the preoperative timing of corticosteroid injection and the incidence of all-cause revision surgery following TSA or rTSA. This analysis suggests that an interval of at least three months should be maintained between corticosteroid injection and TSA or rTSA to minimize risks of subsequent revision surgery.

N2  - Background: Interscalene blocks provide analgesia for shoulder surgery but also cause phrenic nerve paralysis. Liposomal bupivacaine is approved for use in interscalene blocks with the potential to provide longer pain control. However, the impact of liposomal bupivacaine on the phrenic nerve has not been evaluated. It was hypothesized that patients who received an interscalene block with both bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine would have a decreased diaphragmatic excursion when compared to bupivacaine alone at 24 h. Methods: This was a double-blinded study of adult patients who were randomized to receive an interscalene block with either 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine (bupivacaine group) or 10 ml 0.5% bupivacaine plus 10 ml liposomal bupivacaine (liposomal bupivacaine group). Twenty-six patients were randomized with 22 included in the analysis. Diaphragmatic excursion (via ultrasound) and spirometry were assessed before the block, in the postanesthesia care unit, and at 24 h postblock. The primary outcome was diaphragm excursion with sigh. No adverse events were observed. Results: At 24 h, the liposomal bupivacaine group median [25th, 75th], had a greater percent change in diaphragmatic excursion during sigh breath compared to the bupivacaine group, -24% [-30, -9] versus 9% [-8, 26], difference in location, 32 (95% CI, 12 to 52), P = 0.007. Five patients in the liposomal bupivacaine group had a greater than 25% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion at 24 h versus zero in the bupivacaine group. They also had a significantly greater percent reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity compared with the bupivacaine group at 24 h (median decrease of 22% vs. 2%, P = 0.006, and median decrease of 19% vs. 1%, P = 0.049, respectively). Conclusions: The addition of liposomal bupivacaine to bupivacaine in an interscalene block results in statistically significant reductions in diaphragm excursion and pulmonary function testing 24 h after block placement when compared to bupivacaine alone. This reduction, however, falls within the range of normal diaphragmatic function.

N2  - Case:A 60-year-old woman with avascular necrosis of the right humeral head underwent anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA); however, recurrent posterior dislocation occurred 13 months postoperatively. We performed bone block grafting of an autologous iliac crest to the posterior glenoid and posterior capsular plication, after which satisfactory postoperative shoulder function without residual joint instability was achieved.Conclusion:The presented case had recurrent posterior dislocation after TSA without any abnormal findings in the prosthetic components. Posterior bone block grafting with capsular plication should be considered a viable option for posterior instability after anatomical TSA.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether Tranexamic Acid (TXA) can significantly reduce perioperative blood loss in Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) performed under regional anesthesia. Methods: We performed a randomized, single blinded, controlled study. Forty-five patients were submitted to TSA under regional anesthesia to treat cuff tear arthropathy, proximal humeral fractures, chronic instability, primary osteoarthrosis, and failures of previous prosthesis. Patients were randomized to either group TXA therapy (TXA), with 1 g intravenous (IV), or no Intervention (NTXA). Postoperative total drain output, hemoglobin variation, total blood loss, hemoglobin loss, and need for transfusion were measured. Pain-related variables were also assessed: postoperative pain assessment by visual analog scale, inpatient pain breakthrough, quality of recovery, length of stay, and coagulation function testing. Results: Participants presented a mean age of 76 years, 15.6% were male, 82.2% were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II. There were no differences between groups concerning transfusions, operative time, Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) length of stay and in-hospital stay, and QoR-15 or postoperative pain. Bleeding measured by drain output at 2, 24 and 48 hours was significantly less in the TXA group at each timepoint. There was a difference in Hb variation – TXA: median (IQR) -1.4 (1.3) g.dL-1 vs. NTXA: -2.2 (1.3) g.dL-1; median difference: 0.80 (0.00–1.20); p = 0.047. aPTT was lower in TXA administered patients – TXA: median (IQR) 29.6 (14.0)s vs. NTXA: 33 (5.8)s; difference in medians: -4.00 (-6.50–-1.00); p = 0.012. Conclusion: TXA use significantly decreased blood loss measured by drain output and Hb drop in TSA under regional anesthesia.

N2  - Aim: To study the use of a mixed reality holographic application for assistance in glenoid guide pin placement and compare this to patient specific 3D printed guides in a polyurethane Walch B2 glenoid bone substitute model. Background: There are currently several commercially available options for improved accuracy of glenoid guide pin placement during shoulder arthroplasty. Currently these primarily take 2 forms: patient specific instrumentation (PSI) and computer navigation. Mixed reality and virtual reality devices have been utilized in medical education thus far but there has been limited assessment into their intra-operative viability in specific settings such as shoulder arthroplasty. If the use of a mixed reality holographic application can demonstrate comparable success to PSI, it would demonstrate the potential efficacy of this new technology. Methods: 50 glenoid polyurethane saw bones models with a B2 glenoid defect will be made via injection molding techniques using 12lb/ftˆ3 rigid polyurethane foam. The 3D model of the B2 glenoid with the guide pin in place is programmed into a Unity based application that is installed on the Microsoft HoloLens 2. 5 volunteers will drill a guide pin into the “sawbones” models with the attempt to replicate the desired preoperative plan. This will be performed a randomized order to place their glenoid guide pins into the models (free-hand, PSI, HoloLens 2) to minimize the potential for a learning effect to improve guide pin position with time/practice and affect results. The models will be scanned via computerized tomography and 3D models will be generated. These will be compared in CAD software to measure the difference from the planned and executed guidewire placement in the axial plane (version) and coronal plane (inclination) and in the start point. Results: Currently the study is ongoing. The first 15 glenoids have had the guidewire placed thus far. They indicate very similar accuracy of the mixed reality holographic guidance to the PSI guide but more time is required to finish testing and comparing the CT scanned models after the remaining 35 guidewires are placed. This will be accomplished by May 15th 2021. Conclusion: The use of a mixed reality holographic application to assist glenoid guide pin placement in a Walch B2 model provides nearly equal accuracy to patient specific instrumentation. This abstract shows preliminary data and would be finished prior to the September event.

N2  - Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 5.4 million people in the United States. A common treatment is to perform intraarticular corticosteroid injections. However the ideal steroid dose is unknown. This study aimed to pilot a corticosteroid injection protocol for primary glenohumeral OA. Methods: We conducted a double blind randomized feasibility pilot study. Patients with primary OA of the glenohumeral joint were recruited to receive one of three doses of the steroid: 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg. The primary outcome was the feasibility of the protocol. Secondary outcomes were Shoulder Pain and Disability Index and rates of total shoulder arthroplasty at 1 year. Results: 300 patients were screened for participation with 78 meeting inclusion criteria. 19 subjects completed the study. 31 declined participation. The recruitment rate for the study was 24%. There was a 40% refusal rate. The most common reason for not participating was concern they would receive a smaller dose than previous injections. There was a 26% dropout rate, with 2 patients undergoing aTSA, 1 undergoing a labral repair, 2 lost to follow up. For the study groups, the 20 mg group noted a 23% decrease in their SPADI score over 6 months. The 40 mg group had a5%decrease in their scores and the 80mg group had a 42% decrease. There was no clinically significant difference (p=0.090) between the groups at the 6 month time point. 3 patients underwent a TSA during the follow up period. There was one adverse event in the 20 mg group, with a patient experiencing facial flushing after the injection. Conclusions: While conducting this study, several issues were encountered that limited participation and made recruitment difficult. The major reason patients did not want to participate was the concern that they would receive a lower dose of the steroid than previous and that would be less effective. This patient concern highlights the need to complete clinical trials to guide medical decisions surrounding corticosteroid administration. Significance: Understanding the reason for the low participation rates in this study will be helpful to the success of future studies, as there is still further work needed to determine the optimal dose for corticosteroid injections.

N2  - Background: Intraarticular corticosteroid injection is commonly used conservative treatment for glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical fate of symptomatic glenohumeral OA following intraarticular corticosteroid injection and to identify factors associated with undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: Glenohumeral OA patients who had undergone at least one glenohumeral corticosteroid injection from 2012 to 2017 were identified. Data for demographics, comorbidities, number of injections, severity of radiographic arthritis, and subsequent treatment were collected up to February 2020. Data were analyzed to compare between patients who had eventually undergone shoulder arthroplasty and those who had not. Results: A total of 311 shoulders (275 patients) were followed up for 3 to 8 years after the index injection. The mean age of patients was 64.7 years. There were 148 females, and 116 shoulders (37.3%) eventually underwent arthroplasty, 68 (21.9%) further injections only, 104 (33.4%) no further treatment, 14 (4.5%) a non-arthroplasty surgical procedure, and 9 (2.9%) were lost to follow up. Severity of radiographic arthritic changes, female sex, younger age, and nonsmoking status were found to be significantly associated with undergoing arthroplasty (p < 0.001, p = 0.014, p = 0.003, and p = 0.043, respectively). Conclusion: Approximately one third of glenohumeral OA patients who had received an intraarticular corticosteroid injection eventually elected to undergo shoulder arthroplasty within 3 to 8 years of the injection. High-grade arthritic changes in radiographs, female gender, and younger age were found to be independent factors associated with undergoing arthroplasty. This information may be useful in counseling patients about their future clinical course. Level of Evidence: Level III Retrospective comparative study.

N2  - Background: Gradual loss of overhead range of motion (ROM) has been observed after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). It remains unclear if this is caused by the effect of RSA design on muscle fiber lengthening or is part of the natural aging process of the shoulder musculature. Although studies have attempted to evaluate deltoid fatigue after RSA, there is a paucity of literature evaluating this effect after anatomic shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), which would be expected to occur due to aging alone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of time on overhead ROM after aTSA and compare this with previous data on a similar cohort of RSAs. We hypothesized that overhead ROM would decrease gradually over time in both groups without differences between prosthesis types. Methods: A retrospective review of 384 aTSAs without complications was performed over a 10-year period. All shoulders were treated for primary osteoarthritis using a single implant system. Patients were evaluated longitudinally at multiple postoperative time points. At least 1 follow-up visit was between 1 and 2 years postoperatively and another at least 5 years after surgery. ROM and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) were evaluated using linear-mixed models for repeated measures. These results were compared with a previously evaluated cohort of 165 well-functioning RSAs analyzed using the same methodology. Results: Primary aTSA shoulders were observed to lose 0.7° of abduction per year starting 1 year postoperatively (P = .001). Smaller losses were observed in external rotation (−0.3°/yr, P = .06) and internal rotation (−0.04/yr, P < .001). However, no significant losses were observed in forward elevation (P = .8). All PROMs diminished slowly over time, but these changes did not exceed the minimally clinically important difference when modeled over 10 years (Simple Shoulder Test −0.08/yr, P < .001; American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons −0.5/yr, P < .001; University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Score −0.2/yr, P < .001). When compared with a similarly analyzed cohort of RSAs, overhead ROM decreased at a slower rate in the aTSA cohort (abduction −0.7° vs. −0.8°/yr, P = .9; FE −0.06° vs. −0.8°/yr, P = .05). Discussion: In the well-functioning aTSA, gradual loss of ROM occurs in all planes of motion except forward elevation. However, these losses are small and have little meaningful impact relative to minimally clinically important difference thresholds on PROMs. Progressive loss of abduction seen in both aTSA and RSA is likely secondary to aging of the periscapular and rotator cuff musculature. When compared with RSA, loss of motion after aTSA was statistically similar, calling into question the belief that RSA-induced deltoid fatigue leads to loss of overhead motion over time.

N2  - Background: Nonoperative and operative treatment modalities have been used for symptom management of adhesive capsulitis, but neither has been shown to significantly alter the long-term natural history. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to evaluate the current trends in resource and treatment strategy utilization for patients with adhesive capsulitis. It was hypothesized that (1) patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis will primarily undergo nonoperative treatment and (2) patients with systemic medical comorbidities will demonstrate relatively higher utilization of nonoperative therapies. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We searched the Mariner/PearlDiver database for Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes to identify patients with adhesive capsulitis from 2010 to 2020 and to track their usage of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical therapy, surgery, opioids, and injection. Patients with active records 1 year before and 2 years after initial diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis were eligible. Excluded were patients with secondary causes of adhesive capsulitis, such as fracture, infection, prior surgery, or other intra-articular pathology. Results: The median age of this 165,937-patient cohort was 58 years, with 67% being women. There was a high prevalence of comorbid diabetes (44.2%), thyroid disorder (29.6%), and Dupuytren contracture (1.3%). Within 2 years of diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis, diagnostic and therapeutic modality utilization included radiography (47.2%), opioids (46.7%), physical therapy (43.1%), injection (39.0%), MRI (15.8%), arthroscopic surgery (2.7%), and manipulation under anesthesia (2.5%). Over 68% of the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities were rendered from 3 months before to 3 months after diagnosis. Patients with diabetes, thyroid disorders, tobacco use, and obesity had greater odds for treatment with physical therapy, opioids, radiography, and injection when compared with patients without these comorbidities (odds ratio [OR] range, 1.05-2.21; P <.0001). Patients with diabetes and thyroid disorders had decreased odds for surgery (OR range, 0.88-0.91; P ≤.003). Patients with Dupuytren contracture had increased odds for all therapeutic modalities (OR range, 1.20-1.68; P <.0001). Conclusion: Patients with adhesive capsulitis underwent primarily nonoperative treatment, with a high percentage utilizing opioids. The most active periods for treatment were from 3 months before diagnosis to 3 months after, and patients with medical comorbidities were more likely to undergo nonoperative treatment.

N2  - Shoulder pain is a common complaint of diabetic patients that causes motion limitations and functional disability. Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is the most common disabling shoulder disorder. There is no optimal non-surgical treatment for managing AC in patients with diabetes.we are not sure what is the best treatment to manage Frozen Shoulder in patients with diabetes. We donot know how diabetes can affect recovery after shoulder replacement surgery. Also, we arenot sure what factors can affect function after shoulder replacement surgery.Weakness of the shoulder rotator muscles is associated with shoulder pain. Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate a physiotherapy program targeted to reduce pain intensity and improve the daily functioning of diabetics with shoulder problems. It was hypothesized that patients receiving specific physiotherapy treatment improved more frequently and rapidly than diabetic patients followed up without specific physiotherapeutic intervention. Method: A pre-post treatment design was completed for a group of 10 subjects. The treatment protocol, also applied during the daily activities of the subjects, was aiming at reducing pain intensity and shoulder stiffness and improving impaired functioning in daily activities by muscle relaxation, light-load exercise and enhancing the co-ordination.

N2  - Purpose: Glenohumeral joint (GHJ) osteoarthritis (OA) in younger patients represents a challenging problem. This study assessed the efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronate injection in patients below the age of 55 years. Methods: We reviewed our patient database from August 2013 to December 2016 for patients who received a fluoroscopic-guided intra-articular injection of hyaluronate. Those who had received interventional procedures within the preceding 12 months were excluded. We evaluated the response to the injection using the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). These scores were recorded before injection and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks postinjection. Radiographs were reviewed independently by two evaluators, and the severity of GHJ OA was categorized (mild, moderate, or severe) using the Samilson-Prieto classification. Results: Fifty-five patients were identified, with a mean age of 43 years (18.6-54.6 years). These cases were classified as being mild in 11 (20%), moderate in 21 (38%), and severe in 23 (42%) using Samilson-Prieto classification. In the severe group, there was a statistically significant improvement in the OSS at all time points. In the moderate group, there were statistically significant improvements at 6 weeks and 12 weeks but not at 6 months. In the mild group, there were no statistically significant changes. Conclusion: In patients under the age of 55 years with moderate-to-severe GHJ OA, there is a significant improvement in the OSS up to 12 weeks after intra-articular injection of hyaluronate, with improvements lasting up to 26 weeks in more severe cases. Hyaluronate is, therefore, a useful treatment option in younger patients and may potentially delay the need for arthroplasty.

N2  - Background Intranasal corticosteroids are widely used for management of many upper airway diseases because of their ability to effectively deliver local relief of inflammation. Case report This paper presents the case of a 51-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus treated with ritonavir who was started on fluticasone intranasal spray for presumed chronic rhinosinusitis. Months after starting this therapy, he developed symptoms of Cushing's syndrome and avascular necrosis of the shoulder due to the pharmacological interactions between fluticasone and ritonavir. Conclusion Although intranasal corticosteroids are deemed a low-risk route of drug administration, clinicians need to be vigilant in appropriately prescribing corticosteroids in the setting of drug potentiators, particularly in these high-risk patients. Alternative corticosteroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate should be considered in such cases.

N2  - Shoulder pain in the context of rotator cuff disorders is a frequent source of medical consultation. A wide range of therapeutic options is reported in the literature. Non- or minimally invasive treatments include physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and infiltration of corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma. Surgical treatments include subacromial debridement, long head of the biceps tenotomy/tenodesis, rotator cuff repair, superior capsular reconstruction, and tendon transfers. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty completes the therapeutic arsenal. Guiding and advising the patient in the face of all these options can therefore be challenging. This article aims to summarize the clinical, demographic, and imaging characteristics useful in guiding and choosing the most appropriate treatment option for each patient.

N2  - Background: The medical community is beginning to recognize the contribution of prescription opioids in the growing national opioid crisis. Many studies have compared the safety and efficacy of alternative analgesics to opioids, but none utilizing a completely opioid-free perioperative protocol in orthopedics. Methods: We developed and tested an opioid-free perioperative analgesic pathway (from preoperative to postoperative period) among patients undergoing common elective orthopedic procedures. Patients will be randomized to receive either traditional opioid-including or completely opioid-free perioperative medications. This study is being conducted across multiple orthopedic subspecialties in patients undergoing the following common elective orthopedic procedures: single-level or two-level ACDF/ACDA, 1st CMC arthroplasty, Hallux Valgus/Rigidus corrections, diagnostic knee arthroscopies, total hip arthroplasty (THA), and total shoulder arthroplasty/reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA/RTSA). The primary outcome measure is pain score at 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures include pain scores at additional time points, medication side effects, and several patient-reported variables such as patient satisfaction, quality of life, and functional status. Discussion: We describe the methods for a feasibility randomized controlled trial comparing opioid-free perioperative analgesics to traditional opioid-including protocols. We present this study so that it may be replicated and incorporated into future studies at other institutions, as well as disseminated to additional orthopedic and/or non-orthopedic surgical procedures. The ultimate goal of presenting this protocol is to aid recent efforts in reducing the impact of prescription opioids on the national opioid crisis. Trial registration: The protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04176783) on November 25, 2019, retrospectively registered

N2  - Background: The pain control efficacy, postoperative opioid requirements, and costs among patients undergoing major shoulder surgery using different perioperative analgesia modalities have been topics of active debate. Several studies have compared periarticular injection (PAI) to interscalene block (ISB) in shoulder arthroplasty, but there is a paucity of data comparing them in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Methods: Patients aged 18-80 years with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at 2 different shoulder centers were screened and subsequently randomized to receive either periarticular injection (PAI) of liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 0.25% bupivacaine (n = 41) or single-shot interscalene nerve block (ISB) (n = 36). Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, oral morphine equivalent (OME) use, Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) scores, and costs were collected. Differences with P <.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Day of surgery VAS score and OME usage were significantly reduced with ISB vs. PAI (0.69 vs. 4.65, P < .001, and 18.66 vs. 34.39, P < .001, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups regarding VAS score on postoperative days (PODs) 1-3; however, OME usage on PODs 1 (50.5 vs. 38.8, P = .03) and 2 (48.1 vs. 37.8, P = .04) was significantly more in the ISB group. At POD 3, VAS score (4.13 vs. 3.97, P = .60) and OME use (28.60 vs. 31.16, P = .51) were similar. At 6 and 12 weeks, there were also no significant differences between groups regarding VAS and OME use. There was no difference in SANE score at 12 weeks following surgery between groups and no difference between average 12-week cumulative OME use between groups. The average charge for the PAI was $455, and the average charge for ISB was $745. Conclusion: Both ISB and PAI provide acceptable pain control following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patients have less pain on the day of surgery with ISB, but rebound pain is significant after the block wears off, resulting in substantially increased opioid use in the first 2 PODs. However, cumulative opioid use between groups was similar. There were also no significant differences at the end of the 12-week episode of care in any of the other variables studied. The charge per patient for PAI is approximately $300 less than ISB. Thus, PAI may offer surgeons and patients an effective postoperative analgesic modality as an alternative to ISB.

N2  - The rising prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) in the general population has necessitated the development of novel treatment options. It is critical to recognize the joint as a separate entity participating in degenerative processes, as well as the multifaceted nature of OA. OA is incurable because there is currently no medication that can stop or reverse cartilage or bone loss. As this point of view has attracted attention, more research is being directed toward determining how the various joint components are impacted and how they contribute to OA pathogenesis. Over the next few years, several prospective therapies focusing on inflammation, cartilage metabolism, subchondral bone remodelling, cellular senescence, and the peripheral nociceptive pathway are predicted to transform the OA therapy landscape. Stem cell therapies and the use of various biomaterials to target articular cartilage (AC) and osteochondral tissues are now being investigated in considerable detail. Currently, laboratory-made cartilage tissues are on the verge of being used in clinical settings. This review focuses on the update of clinical prospects and management of osteoarthritis, as well as future possibilities for the treatment of OA.

N2  - Background: P-selectin expressed on endothelium and platelets has been implicated in the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Crizanlizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-P-selectin antibody approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency of VOCs. While severe adverse events (AEs) are rare, over 80% of patients most commonly have headache, back pain, nausea, or arthralgia; infusion-related reactions occurred in 3% according to the package insert. We report on 2 patients whose crizanlizumab-associated reactions help shed light on how to manage such events and possible mechanisms. Case reports: Case 1, a 48-year-old woman with hemoglobin SC disease, history of left shoulder replacement due to avascular necrosis and left knee avascular necrosis, pending surgical replacement. Given her frequent pain episodes, she was initiated on crizanlizumab after being intolerant to hydroxyurea (watery diarrhea). She received the first dose of crizanlizumab uneventfully, but at the end of her second infusion, she developed acute bilateral groin pain that radiated to both legs. She was eventually admitted to the hospital with a fever of 38-39°C without evidence of infection. She also received one unit of RBC transfusion for a drop in Hct from 32% to 25%. For her third infusion, we premedicated her with acetaminophen 650mg, diphenhydramine 50mg, ketorolac 1g along with concurrent IV hydration. She tolerated an initial infusion at 20ml/h for the first 15 minutes after which we ramped it up to the regular rate of 200ml/h. Within minutes of that rate increase, the patient developed chest pain and dyspnea, so infusion was stopped immediately. Blood samples taken right after the event revealed tryptase and IgE levels within normal limits, and she chose to discontinue the medication. Case 2, a 20-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia with frequent painful episodes despite hydroxyurea at 25mg/kg/day. The patient preferred to start crizanlizumab over increasing oral medication. She reported having had fever and chills at home after her first crizanlizumab infusion and improved with acetaminophen. About 10 minutes into her second infusion, she developed acute severe migratory pain in her back, moving to her lower limbs, associated with tachycardia. Infusion was immediately discontinued, and she was medicated with diphenhydramine 25mg and methylprednisolone 125mg with no improvement. She progressed with abdominal pain moving into her arms and needed meperidine 25mg and hydromorphone 1mg to achieve pain resolution. She completed the infusion successfully at 50% reduced rate but still reported subjective high fevers and chills again the next day, medicated with acetaminophen. She continues monthly infusions with a slower rate. Discussion: As of October 2020, Novartis (manufacturer of crizanlizumab) informed that, out of 3,500 patients, there have been 22 postmarketing reports of severe pain during or within 24 hours of the infusion. Seven cases reported complications, all of which resolved. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies can be a cytokine release syndrome, IgE-mediated, or IgG-mediated. One case report has suggested this may be a complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) as sC5b-9 was mildly elevated in a 17-year-old male patient who developed sudden and severe pain in his back, legs and head within 10 minutes of the infusion, despite having been premedicated with acetaminophen, later developing a fever and need for admission. Differently from that case, our patients developed severe pain with a second exposure of the drug, arguing in favor of an antibody-mediated process. We did not find evidence of mast cell activation or increased IgE production in our patient who needed to discontinue the medication. We therefore hypothesize that crizanlizumab-associated painful febrile reaction may be IgG-mediated. Premedication in our experience was unsuccessful, and symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen was appropriate, but slower infusion rates may prove useful for some patients. Conclusion: While rare, crizanlizumab-associated painful febrile reactions may be observed after a first uneventful infusion and are possibly IgG-mediated. Patients experiencing this reaction may require symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen despite premedication and can be tried on slower infusion rates.

N2  - » For shoulder arthroplasty, regional anesthesia is safer when compared with general anesthesia. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the superiority of regional anesthesia with respect to pulmonary complications and hospital length of stay.» Infiltration of the shoulder with local anesthetics offers no additional benefits compared with single-shot or continuous brachial plexus blocks for shoulder arthroplasty.» There is high-quality evidence (Level I) demonstrating lower pain scores and lower perioperative opioid requirements after a continuous peripheral nerve block compared with a single-shot nerve block. However, catheter dislodgment and logistical issues with catheter insertion are impediments to the widespread usage of a continuous nerve block with an indwelling catheter.» Liposomal bupivacaine is comparable with non-liposomal local anesthetic agents with respect to pain relief, the opioid-sparing effect, and adverse effects in the first 48 hours after total shoulder arthroplasty.» Perioperative dexamethasone administration improves postoperative pain control, decreases perioperative opioid requirements, and reduces postoperative nausea.

N2  - Introduction: Patients who undergo total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) may experience substantial postoperative pain, which may negatively impact patient satisfaction, lead to greater narcotic consumption, and impair early rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of analgesia methods on postoperative (1) pain, (2) opioid use, (3) length of stay (LOS), and (4) adverse events in patients undergoing TSA, reverse TSA, and hemiarthroplasty. Methods: A systematic review was performed by querying PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials for studies on analgesic interventions following shoulder arthroplasty. Data pertaining to pain scores, narcotic requirements, LOS, and complications were extracted. Results: Eight studies (67%) included continuous interscalene block (CISB) with an indwelling catheter, six studies (50%) included a single-injection interscalene block (ISB), five studies (42%) included local infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine, four studies (33%) included local infiltration with anesthetics other than liposomal bupivacaine, one study (8%) included brachial plexus blocks other than ISB. ISB provided better pain relief than local infiltration in the immediate postoperative period (0-8 hours) as seen in 5/7 (71.4%) studies, but pain levels became similar subsequently. CISB may be superior to single-injection ISB for pain control at the 24-hour time point. The lowest narcotic requirement was seen in the CISB groups postoperatively but was variable. No pain management modalities significantly impacted LOS. A greater number of adverse events were seen with CISB. Discussion: Single-injection ISB and CISB appear to offer greater pain relief in the immediate postoperative period compared to local infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine or other anesthetics. CISB provided sustained pain relief at 24 hours compared to other modalities. Analgesic benefit of CISB should be considered in the context of greater cost and potential for more frequent adverse events. Level of Evidence: Level I; Systematic Review

N2  - Background: Postoperative pain management after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) can be challenging. Given the variety of pain management options available, the purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials reporting on pain control after shoulder arthroplasty. We sought to determine which modalities are most effective in managing postoperative pain and reducing postoperative opioid use. Methods: A systematic review was performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for Level I-II randomized controlled trials that compared interventions for postoperative pain control after TSA. Pain control measures included nerve blocks and nerve block adjuncts, local injections, patient-controlled analgesia, oral medications, and other modalities. The 2 primary outcome measures were pain level measured on a 0-10 visual analog scale and opioid use. The risk of study bias and methodologic quality were analyzed using The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. Network meta-analyses were performed for visual analog scale pain scores at postsurgical time points and opioid use using a frequentist approach and random-effects model, with heterogeneity quantified using the I2 statistic. Treatments were ranked using the P score, and statistical significance was set at P < .05. Results: The initial search yielded 2391 articles (695 duplicates, 1696 screened, 53 undergoing full-text review). Eighteen articles (1358 shoulders; 51% female patients; mean age range, 65-73.7 years; 4 studies with low risk of bias, 12 with some risk, and 2 with high risk) were included and analyzed. At 4 and 8 hours postoperatively, patients receiving local liposomal bupivacaine (LB) injection (P < .001 for 4 and 8 hours) or local ropivacaine injection (P < .001 for 4 hours and P = .019 for 8 hours) had significantly more pain compared with patients who received either a continuous interscalene block (cISB) or single-shot interscalene block (ssISB). No differences in opioid use (at P < .05) were detected between modalities. The P scores of treatments demonstrated that ssISBs were most favorable at time points < 24 hours, whereas pain at 24 and 48 hours after surgery was best managed with cISBs or a combination of an ssISB with a local LB injection. Conclusion: Interscalene blocks are superior to local injections alone at managing pain after TSA. Single-shot interscalene blocks are optimal for reducing early postoperative pain (< 24 hours), whereas pain at 24-48 hours after surgery may be best managed with cISBs or a combination of an ssISB with a local LB injection.

N2  - Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has become an increasingly popular surgery for patients with rotator cuff arthropathy, unreconstructible proximal humeral fracture, and end-stage glenohumeral arthritis. The increased annual volume of RTSAs has resulted in more postoperative complications and revision rates between 3.3% and 10.1%. Postoperative infection is one of the most common complications requiring revision surgery after primary RTSA. This study assesses patient-specific risk factors for development of early infection after primary RTSA in a single high-volume shoulder arthroplasty institution. Methods: From 2014 to 2019, 902 consecutive primary RTSAs were performed for surgical treatment of rotator cuff arthropathy, glenohumeral arthritis, inflammatory arthropathy, and/or dislocation. Excluding proximal humeral or scapula fractures, 756 cases met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum of 3-month follow-up. All surgeries were performed using the same surgical technique and received similar antibiotic prophylaxis. Age, patient demographics, medical history, smoking history, and prior ipsilateral shoulder treatment and/or surgery were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with development of postoperative shoulder infection. Results: Thirty-five patients did not meet minimum follow-up criteria and were lost to follow-up. Overall, of 721, 22 patients (3%) developed a postoperative ipsilateral shoulder infection. Previous nonarthroplasty surgery and history of rheumatoid arthritis were significantly associated with the development of postoperative shoulder infection. Amongst 196 patients who had previous nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery, there were 12 postoperative shoulder infections (6%) compared with those without previous shoulder surgery (10 of 525, 2%) (P =.003). Among 58 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there were 5 postoperative shoulder infections (9%) compared with patients without rheumatoid arthritis (17 of 663, 3%) (P =.010). Patient age, gender, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, history of cancer/immunosuppression, and prior cortisone injection did not demonstrate significant associations with the development of postoperative infection. Conclusion: Prior nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery and/or rheumatoid arthritis are independently associated with the development of postoperative infection after primary RTSA. Patients who demonstrate these risk factors should be appropriately evaluated and preoperatively counseled before undergoing primary RTSA. Strong consideration should be given to avoid minimally invasive nonarthroplasty surgery as a temporizing measure to delay definitive RTSA.

N2  - Introduction: Patients who receive orthopedic implants have been shown to develop sensitivity to its components and there are concerns that this sensitivity might lead to contact dermatitis or implant-related problems like loosening and/or failure. The objective of the study was to determine the sensitizing potential of orthopedic implants. Methods: Fifty-four patients undergoing knee, hip, or shoulder replacement surgeries between July 2014 and July 2015 were recruited. Patch tests were performed before the implant surgery with 10 allergens likely to be implicated in metal hypersensitivity. Postimplant patch test was performed 6 months after surgery. A majority of the patch tests were applied on the arms. Results: Four positive reactions were recorded in the preimplant patch tests - three positive reactions to nickel and one to chromium. Thirty patients made themselves available for the follow-up patch test. The incidence of new contact sensitivity to components of implants was 13.8% (4/29) at 6 months. One patient who had undergone knee replacement developed eczematous lesions around the knee joint after surgery. This patient tested negative to patch test at both the times. Limitations: Short follow-up duration and performing patch tests on the arms, a site known to elicit less positive patch test response compared to the back in sensitized individuals, are limitations of the study. Conclusion: There is an increase in the sensitivity to implanted components after 6 months of joint replacement surgery. The incidence of new sensitivity to a component of the implant was 13.8% (4/29). In this context, nickel is a good sensitizer and could sensitize 50% of patients who received a nickel-containing implant.

N2  - Background: P-selectin expressed on endothelium and platelets has been implicated in the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Crizanlizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-P-selectin antibody approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency of VOCs. While severe adverse events (AEs) are rare, over 80% of patients most commonly have headache, back pain, nausea, or arthralgia; infusion-related reactions occurred in 3% according to the package insert. We report on 2 patients whose crizanlizumab-associated reactions help shed light on how to manage such events and possible mechanisms. Case reports: Case 1, a 48-year-old woman with hemoglobin SC disease, history of left shoulder replacement due to avascular necrosis and left knee avascular necrosis, pending surgical replacement. Given her frequent pain episodes, she was initiated on crizanlizumab after being intolerant to hydroxyurea (watery diarrhea). She received the first dose of crizanlizumab uneventfully, but at the end of her second infusion, she developed acute bilateral groin pain that radiated to both legs. She was eventually admitted to the hospital with a fever of 38-39°C without evidence of infection. She also received one unit of RBC transfusion for a drop in Hct from 32% to 25%. For her third infusion, we premedicated her with acetaminophen 650mg, diphenhydramine 50mg, ketorolac 1g along with concurrent IV hydration. She tolerated an initial infusion at 20ml/h for the first 15 minutes after which we ramped it up to the regular rate of 200ml/h. Within minutes of that rate increase, the patient developed chest pain and dyspnea, so infusion was stopped immediately. Blood samples taken right after the event revealed tryptase and IgE levels within normal limits, and she chose to discontinue the medication. Case 2, a 20-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia with frequent painful episodes despite hydroxyurea at 25mg/kg/day. The patient preferred to start crizanlizumab over increasing oral medication. She reported having had fever and chills at home after her first crizanlizumab infusion and improved with acetaminophen. About 10 minutes into her second infusion, she developed acute severe migratory pain in her back, moving to her lower limbs, associated with tachycardia. Infusion was immediately discontinued, and she was medicated with diphenhydramine 25mg and methylprednisolone 125mg with no improvement. She progressed with abdominal pain moving into her arms and needed meperidine 25mg and hydromorphone 1mg to achieve pain resolution. She completed the infusion successfully at 50% reduced rate but still reported subjective high fevers and chills again the next day, medicated with acetaminophen. She continues monthly infusions with a slower rate. Discussion: As of October 2020, Novartis (manufacturer of crizanlizumab) informed that, out of 3,500 patients, there have been 22 postmarketing reports of severe pain during or within 24 hours of the infusion. Seven cases reported complications, all of which resolved. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies can be a cytokine release syndrome, IgE-mediated, or IgGmediated. One case report has suggested this may be a complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) as sC5b-9 was mildly elevated in a 17-year-old male patient who developed sudden and severe pain in his back, legs and head within 10 minutes of the infusion, despite having been premedicated with acetaminophen, later developing a fever and need for admission. Differently from that case, our patients developed severe pain with a second exposure of the drug, arguing in favor of an antibody-mediated process. We did not find evidence of mast cell activation or increased IgE production in our patient who needed to discontinue the medication. We therefore hypothesize that crizanlizumab-associated painful febrile reaction may be IgG-mediated. Premedication in our experience was unsuccessful, and symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen was appropriate, but slower infusion rates may prove useful for some patients. Conclusion: While rare, crizanlizumab-associated painful febrile reactions may be observed after a first uneventful infusion and are possibly IgG-mediated. Patients experiencing this reaction may require symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen despite premedication and can be tried on slower infusion rates.

N2  - Enhanced recovery (ER) programmes are well established in hip and knee arthroplasty, but are not yet commonplace for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). This study analyses the effect of implementing an ER programme with TSA, on length of stay (LOS), functional outcome and patient satisfaction. No established programme applying ER to the specifics of upper-limb arthroplasty existed at our unit. A three-cycle plan–do–study–act quality improvement methodology was applied, involving development of our multifactorial programme, a pilot phase and wider roll-out. A consecutive series of patients who underwent TSA and were enrolled in an ER programme were compared with a matched control group of consecutive patients who underwent TSA in the year before the programme started. For all patients, LOS as well as mean Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and Constant Score (CS) were quantified and patient satisfaction assessed. A dedicated multidisciplinary team led preoperative class involving patient education, advice and occupational therapy assessment. A standardised perioperative anaesthetic regime based on regional anaesthetic techniques with preoperative analgesic and nutritional loading was introduced. Postoperative rehabilitation was also standardised with slings for comfort only and early safe-zone mobilisation. New patient information was developed. 71 patients were included in matched cohorts. Mean LOS was reduced from 2.4 nights to 1.9 nights. The single night stay rate improved from 40% to 49%. Across the ER cohort, 15 less nights were required to complete same volume of surgeries as in the non-ER cohort. Parity in OSS and CS measured at 3 and 12 months after surgery were observed in both cohorts. Satisfaction was already high before ER but scores stayed the same or improved across all areas surveyed. Absolute complication rates of 9.9% in the non-ER group and 7% in the ER group were recorded. Our ER programme benefited patients and the Trust by reducing time in hospital and improving patient satisfaction without an adverse effect on complication rate.

N2  - Background: Despite its potential biomechanical advantages, reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is still considered to be particularly high risk in rheumatoid patients who are osteoporotic and immunodeficient. Our purpose was to report prosthesis survival, complications, and outcomes of RSA in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at minimum 5-year follow-up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study including 65 consecutive primary RSAs performed in 59 patients with RA between 1991 and 2010. We excluded rheumatoid patients with previous failed anatomic shoulder arthroplasty. Age at surgery averaged 69 years (range, 46-86 years). A structural bone grafting was performed in 18 cases (45%), using the humeral head in 15 cases (BIO-RSA technique), the iliac crest in 2 cases (Norris technique), and an allograft in 1 case. The mean follow-up was 92 months (range, 60-147 months) or until revision surgery. Results: Revision-free survivorship, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 96% at 7 years. Two patients had revision surgeries for infections, with associated glenoid loosening in 1 case. No humeral loosening was recorded. The mean adjusted Constant score improved from 36% ± 23% preoperatively to 90% ± 26% postoperatively, and mean Subjective Shoulder Value improved from 21% ± 13% to 85% ± 12%, respectively (P < .001). Active anterior elevation increased from 65° ± 43° to 132° ± 27°, active external rotation increased from 10° ± 26° to 22° ± 27°, and internal rotation improved from buttocks to waist (P < .001). Stable fixation of the baseplate was achieved in all cases (including the 6 patients with end-stage RA), and we did not observe bone graft nonunion or resorption. Preoperative radiologic pattern (centered, ascending, or destructive), presence of acromial fractures or tilt (4 cases, 10%), and scapular notching (55%) on final radiographs were not found to influence outcomes or complication rate. Patients with absent/atrophied teres minor had lower functional results. Overall, 95% of the patients were satisfied with the procedure. Conclusion: RSA is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of RA patients, with a low risk of complications and low rate of revision, regardless of the radiologic presentation and stage of the disease. Rheumatoid patients undergoing primary RSA, with or without glenoid bone grafting, can expect a revision-free survival rate of 96% at 7-year follow-up. RSA offers the benefit of solving 2 key problems encountered in rheumatoid shoulders: glenoid bone destruction and rotator cuff deficiency.

N2  - Purpose: Post-traumatic osteonecrosis of the humeral head has a risk of progression to collapse in absence of treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of mesenchymal stem cell grafting of the pre-collapse humeral head (study group) in adult patients with osteonecrosis and to compare the results with a simple core decompression without cells (control group). Patients After inclusion and randomization of 50 patients, 26 patients were enrolled in a single-blinded study for the cell therapy group. Twenty-four other patients were treated with simple core decompression without cells (control group). Material and methods: After a mean of 12-year (range 10 to 15) follow-up, X-ray and MRI were used to evaluate the radiological results, while the Constant score and the visual analog scale were chosen to assess the clinical results. The cell therapy group was treated with percutaneous mesenchymal cell (MSCs) injection obtained from bone marrow concentration. The average total number of MSCs (counted as the number of colony-forming units-fibroblast) injected in each humeral head was a total injection of average 180,000 ± 35,000 cells (range 74,000 to 460,000). Results: Both the treatment and control groups had a significantly improved clinical score (p < 0.01). At the last follow-up, pain on the visual analog scale and Constant score in the study group had significant improvement (respectively p < 0.001 and p < 0.01) as compared to the control group. Collapse was observed more frequently in the control group (87.5% versus 11.5% for cell therapy, p < 0.0001). The survival rates based on the requirement for further shoulder surgery (arthroplasty) as an endpoint were higher in the cell therapy group in comparison to those in the control group (92% versus 25%; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Core decompression with cell therapy was a safe and effective procedure for treatment in the pre-collapse stages of posttraumatic shoulder osteonecrosis and improved the outcome of the disease as compared with simple core decompression without cells.

N2  - Background: Stem-free shoulder arthroplasty has recently been shown to have comparable results to stemmed arthroplasty, though stemless designs are typically used in a younger patient population. Additionally, although the native humeral head is elliptical in shape, clinical results with ellipsoid implants in shoulder arthroplasty have not been reported on previously. This case series reports on the outcomes of a recently introduced anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty with an ellipsoid-shaped articular surface and unique multiplanar platform type of stemless fixation. Methods: This retrospective case series examines the initial cohort of patients who received an anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty using an ellipsoid stem-free humeral prosthesis and an all-polyethylene glenoid component from the Catalyst CSR Total Shoulder System (Catalyst OrthoScience) over a 1-year period. Inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of advanced glenohumeral joint arthritis with an intact rotator cuff, regardless of patient age. Clinical outcomes including shoulder range of motion and patient-reported outcome measures, as well as radiographs, were evaluated at multiple time points postoperatively, with minimum 2-year follow-up. Results: Sixty-three shoulders in 57 patients with a mean age of 73.0 years (range 60-85 years) were included in the study with a mean follow-up period of 30.5 months (range 24-41 months). Forward elevation improved from 121° to 150° (P < .0001), external rotation improved from 28° to 48° (P < .0001), and internal rotation improved from L3 to L1 (P < .001). There were statistically significant improvements exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) score (37 to 94, P < .001), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) (40 to 93, P < .001), visual analog scale (6.3 to 0.4, P < .001), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical domain T score (44 to 57, P < .001). The improvement in the ASES score also exceeded the threshold for the substantial clinical benefit. Age, sex, and preoperative glenoid morphology did not appear to have an effect on the clinical outcome scores. There were no implant failures or evidence of radiographic loosening of the humerus component in any patients. Conclusion: At 2-year minimum follow-up, this stem-free ellipsoid humerus total shoulder arthroplasty provides very good results with high patient satisfaction, clinical improvement in all outcome measures studied, and no signs of loosening.

N2  - Background: Medical malpractice is a very common occurrence that many medical providers will have to face; approximately 17,000 medical malpractice cases are filed in the United States each year, and more than 99% of all surgeons are faced with at least 1 instance of malpractice litigation throughout their careers. Malpractice litigation also carries a major economic weight, with medical malpractice spending resulting in an aggregate expenditure of nearly $60 billion annually in the United States. Orthopedic surgery is one of the most common subspecialties involved in malpractice claims. Currently, there are no comprehensive studies examining malpractice lawsuits within shoulder and elbow surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to examine trends in malpractice claims in shoulder and elbow surgery. Methods: The Westlaw online legal database was queried in order to identify state and federal jury verdicts and settlements pertaining to shoulder and elbow surgery from 2010-2020. Only cases involving medical malpractice in which an orthopedic shoulder and elbow surgeon was a named defendant were included for analysis. All available details pertaining to the cases were collected. This included plaintiff demographic and geographic data. Details regarding the cases were also collected, such as anatomic location, pathology, complications, and case outcomes. Results: Twenty-five malpractice lawsuits pertaining to orthopedic shoulder and elbow surgery were identified. Most plaintiffs in these cases were adult men, and the majority of cases were filed in the Southwest (28%) and Midwest (28%) regions of the United States. The most common anatomic region involved in claims was the rotator cuff (32%), followed by the glenohumeral joint (20%). The majority of these claims involved surgery (56%). Pain of mechanical nature was the most common complication seen in claims (56%). The jury ruled in favor of the defendant surgeon in most cases (80%). Discussion: This is the first study that comprehensively examines the full scope of orthopedic shoulder and elbow malpractice claims across the United States. The most common complaint that plaintiffs reported at the time of litigation was residual pain after treatment due to a mechanical etiology, followed by complaints of nerve damage. A large portion of claims resulted after nonoperative treatment. A better understanding of the trends within malpractice claims is crucial to developing strategies for prevention.

N2  - Introduction: Acromial fracture after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a known complication. These fractures are difficult to treat and negatively impact outcomes in patients who experience them. As the rate of RSA increases worldwide, it will be valuable to identify ways to decrease the risk of postoperative acromion fractures. The goal of this study was to evaluate if injecting an acromion with a synthetic bone graft substitute can strengthen the acromion and theoretically provide a means to reduce the incidence of acromial fractures after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: Eight cadaveric scapulae matched pairs (n = 16) were randomly allocated to two groups with the contralateral side in the different group. The experimental group (n = 8) had synthetic bone graft filler (CERAMENT) injected while the control group (n = 8) did not. The experimental group had the injection both through an anterolateral and posterolateral corners of the acromion for filling of the acromion. Each scapulae was fixed to the base of a MTS Bionix test frame. Cantilever bending testing to failure was performed on each scapulae with a loading rate of 0.1 mm/s. Failure load (N), force (N/mm), and displacement (mm) were recorded and compared for each specimen. CT scans and fluoroscopy imaging was performed for each specimen before and after testing. Results: All 16 specimens were available for analysis. The experimental group was injected with 4 cc +/- 0.5 showed material-to-area ratio fill of 39% mid-acromial area and 38% of the acromial area at the Levy I-II junction. The load to failure was 396 N +/- 89 in the control group and 521 N +/-147 in the experimental group (P = .017). Displacement at failure was less for the control group at 8 mm +/- 2 mm compared to the experimental group at 12 mm +/- 4 mm (P = .051). All samples failed with Levy Type II acromion fractures. Conclusion: This biomechanical study showed that injection of 4 cc of flowable synthetic bone graft filler into the acromion increased load to failure 32% compared to control scapulae. The stiffness was greater and the displacement before failure was greater in the control group compared to the experimental group, although not statistically significant. The ability for the acromion to plastically deform a greater distance prior to failure allow for greater resistance to fracture under higher tensile loads when flowable bone graft filler is injected. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study.

N2  - Fractures of the scapular spine are relatively rare and can occur without (1) or with (2) association to a reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). To date there are only limited data on the topic. The aim of this scoping review was to identify all available literature and report current treatment concepts. A scoping review was conducted by searching PubMed for relevant studies between 2000 and October 2020. All studies were included which gave detailed descriptions of the treatment strategy. A total of 21 studies with 81 patients were included for the analysis. The mean age over all patients was 62 years (range: 24 to 89 years) and 77% of the patients were female. In 19.8% of cases, the fracture occurred after a traumatic fall from standing height. Eighty-six per cent of the patients had an RSA-associated scapular spine fracture (2). These patients were older compared to group (1) (47 ± 19.6 vs. 76 ± 5.6 years, p = 0.0001) and the majority were female (85%). The majority from group (1) underwent operative treatment with plate fixation. Most patients regained full function and range of motion. RSA-associated fractures (2) were mainly treated non-operatively, with moderate clinical outcome. A high rate of nonunions was reported. Scapular spine fractures without RSA are mainly treated operatively with good clinical results. In association with RSA, scapular spine fractures are mainly treated non-operatively and lead to inferior clinical and radiological results. This scenario seems to be problematic and further research is required to sharpen treatment concepts in this group.

N2  - Aim: To assess the outcome of platelet rich plasma injections (PRP) in patients with recalcitrant shoulder pathology using steroid injections as a control. Method: This was a pragmatic retrospective analysis of patients treated for recalcitrant shoulder pathology between October 2018 to March 2019 with either PRP or steroid injection. Results: In the PRP group 10 patients (n=15) had previous steroid injections and 7 had previous surgery. 2 progressed to shoulder replacement. 5 have progressed to arthropathy. 4 patients were discharged due to improving symptoms. In the steroid group 2 patients (n=15) were lost to follow up, 0 had previous surgery and 1 had a previous steroid injection. 6 were discharged due to improving symptoms. The average time to discharge post procedure was 241 days for PRP and 173 days for the steroid group. No complications were noted in either group. Conclusions: Our findings show that PRP injections are a safe and effective treatment for cases of recalcitrant shoulder pathology leading to a 27% success rate for patients who have required steroid injections or arthroscopy in the past. In patients with arthropathy, PRP only has a short effect and should only be offered to patients that are unable to have surgery either due to high risk or patient choice. PRP requires a centrifuge machine and an operating theatre, thus incurring higher costs compared to steroid injections which may be given in clinic. Steroid injections should therefore remain the first line of treatment for recalcitrant shoulder pathology.

N2  - Background/Purpose: It can be challenging to determine whether rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who require arthroplasty have ongoing inflammation, in addition to damage in the affected joint on clinical exam. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutrophil-lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratios (PLR) are all blood biomarkers that have been reported to associate with disease activity. Methods: 239 patients meeting ACR/EULAR 1987 and/or 2010 RA criteria and 162 OA patients were recruited prior to elective total hip, knee, elbow, or shoulder arthroplasty. Disease characteristics and blood samples were collected pre-operatively. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of the synovium were prepared and scored by a pathologist. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare biomarkers among groups. Stata's backward stepwise regression and multivariable ordered logistic regression was performed to predict synovial lymphocytic inflammation on (1) 239 RA patients, (2) 146 RA patients not on GCs, and (3) 52 RA patients with low disease activity (DAS28-ESR< 3.2). Results: RA patients (median [IQR] = 159.6 [103.1]) had higher PLR than OA patients (median [IQR] = 138.9[76.5]) (p< 0.001). RA patients (median [IQR] = 2.73 [2.34]) also had a slightly higher NLR compared to OA patients (median [IQR] = 2.45[1.90]) (p=0.052). Additionally, RA patients on glucocorticoids (GCs) had higher NLR (p< 0.001) and PLR (p=0.04) than those not on GCs. In all models predicting SLI in RA, PLR was significantly associated with SLI but not DAS28-ESR or CDAI (Table 1 and Table 2). Patients with DAS28-ESR< 3.2 and high SLI had higher PLR (p=0.01) and CRP (p=0.02) (Figure 1) than those with low SLI. PLR was not associated with SLI in OA patients. Conclusion: Platelet lymphocyte ratio is associated with synovial lymphocytic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients of all disease activity levels. This suggests that inexpensive, routinely performed blood tests may be a useful blood biomarker of RA synovial inflammation, including subclinical synovitis. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a relatively new diagnosis for a constellation of symptoms with sometimes devastating results for patients. A 40-year old woman with MCAS underwent arthroscopic repair of her right shoulder, with successful anesthetic management. This case report discusses the basic immunologic physiology surrounding this syndrome, myriad medications often used by this patient population, and the anesthetic management of this patient. With additional knowledge of this disorder, exposure to its clinical presentation in the perioperative setting, and anesthetic considerations specific to MCAS, the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist will be better equipped to effectively manage the complex requirements of this patient population.

N2  - Background: Multimodal pain control can be beneficial in relieving postoperative pain and limiting narcotic use following orthopedic procedures. Additionally, with increasing interest in outpatient arthroplasty procedures, providers have interest in adequate early postoperative pain control and complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and length of stay following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Methods: One hundred twelve patients undergoing TSA or RTSA by a single surgeon were assessed for inclusion in this investigation. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of 10 mg of dexamethasone administered within 90 minutes of surgery. Primary outcome assessed was the average morphine equivalent use over the first 24 hours postsurgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores, antiemetic use, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and complications. Results: A total of 75 patients were included in the final analysis, with 32 patients (42.7%) randomized to the control group and 43 (57.3%) randomized to the dexamethasone group. Body mass index was significantly greater in the control group (33.8 vs. 30.3, P =.014); otherwise, there were no significant demographic differences between groups. Average ondansetron use was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group compared with controls for the 0- to 4-hour interval (0.1 vs. 0.9 mg, respectively, P =.006) and was lower overall for the first 24 hours (0.3 vs. 1.0 mg, P =.025). Differences in VAS scores were significantly lower in the dexamethasone group at all time points (P <.05 for all). The average VAS score over the 24-hour period for the dexamethasone group was also significantly lower than the controls (3 vs. 6, P <.001). Morphine equivalent use was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group compared with controls at 12-16 hours (1.7 vs. 4.0 mg, respectively, P =.004) and at 16-20 hours (1.7 vs. 3.4 mg, respectively, P =.006). When averaged over the first 24 hours, morphine equivalent was also significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (16.1 vs. 25.4 mg, P =.007). There was no significant difference in glucose control or complications between groups. Conclusion: Dexamethasone decreases opioid requirements in the first 24 hours following surgery, provides improved pain control, and decreases antiemetic use following shoulder arthroplasty. Dexamethasone is an important multimodal adjunct for controlling pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting following primary TSA.

N2  - Background: Interscalene nerve block (INB) has become a popular technique for shoulder anesthesia. However, INB is associated with complication rates as high as 20%. Local liposomal bupivacaine (LLB) is an alternative to INB that potentially offers extended pain control with fewer adverse effects. Methods: We conducted a dual-center randomized controlled trial of 108 participants who were treated with LLB (n = 54) or INB (n = 54) to control pain after shoulder arthroplasty. We assessed visual analog scale pain scores at 6-hour intervals from 6 to 96 hours postoperatively and at the first postoperative visit. We assessed opioid medication consumption intraoperatively and on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 postoperatively, as well as the duration of hospital and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stays. Results: At 6 hours postoperatively, the mean visual analog scale pain score was lower in the INB group (2.9 ± 3.1) than in the LLB group (5.1 ± 2.9, P < .01). The INB group consumed less opioid medication during the first 24 hours postoperatively (18 ± 12 morphine milligram equivalents) than did the LLB group (36 ± 48 morphine milligram equivalents, P = .01). The PACU stay was shorter in the INB group (102 ± 53 minutes) compared with the LLB group (139 ± 77 minutes, P < .01). Conclusions: Compared with LLB, INB provides better pain control immediately after shoulder arthroplasty as evidenced by shorter PACU stays, lower pain scores at 6 hours postoperatively, and less opioid medication consumption during the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, no differences in outcomes were observed between groups beyond 24 hours.

N2  - Background: Recent “multimodal” approaches to pain, although understudied, have shown promise in reducing reliance on narcotics in shoulder arthroplasty (SA). Many surgeons report being unsure of how many narcotic pills to prescribe after the surgery. As result, patients are prescribed upwards of 60 oxycodone 5-mg pills for a 6-to-12-week treatment period despite studies showing postoperative pain can be managed without any medication at all. Purpose: The purpose of this multicenter study was to prospectively determine the number of opiate pills required after SA to develop generalizable, evidence-based prescription guidelines for surgeons. We hypothesized that opioid prescription would be low using a multimodal approach to pain management. Methods: The study enrolled 63 patients undergoing SA. Subjects received either an interscalene nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine, standard bupivacaine, or a local infiltration standard bupivacaine field block based on preference. All subjects were provided with postoperative “Pain Journals” to document their daily pain on a Numerical Rating Scale and daily opioid consumption during the 14-day postoperative period. Results: Overall, patients consumed an average of 8.6 oxycodone 5-mg pills (64.5 morphine milligram equivalents) after SA. Seventy-nine percent of patients required 15 or fewer oxycodone 5-mg pills, and 27% successfully managed their postoperative pain with zero opioids. Average pain remained low for patients in all groups. Conclusion: With a multimodal approach, most patients undergoing SA can manage postoperative pain with 15 or fewer oxycodone 5-mg tablets, or 112.5 morphine milligram equivalents. The addition of a liposomal bupivacaine interscalene nerve block may further reduce the consumption of postoperative narcotics compared with a standard interscalene nerve block. This study provides evidence that may be used for surgeon guidelines in the effort to reduce opioid prescriptions after SA.

N2  - A retired metal machinist presented with extending erythematous infiltrated plaques on his right upper arm of 2 years' duration, night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and weight loss. His symptoms had been unresponsive to three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) given for presumed angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The rash involved the scar from a right anatomical Depuy Synthes Epocca cementless total shoulder replacement (TSR) 3 years previously (titanium Ti-6-AI-7Nb eccenter, titanium press fit stem, a cobalt chromium head and polyethylene ultrahigh-molecular-weight glenoid). He reported right shoulder mechanical pain, reduced range of movement and weakness. He was patch tested to the British Society for Cutaneous Allergy standard, and a metal, acrylate and joint prosthesis series, including cobalt, potassium dichromate, aluminium, titanium oxide and components of bone cement. There was an allergic contact reaction to benzothiazolinone, possibly due to sensitization from machine oils, of no current relevance, with irritant reactions to cobalt on days 2, 4 and 7. Initial and repeat skin biopsies showed a palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis. The latter may be associated with connective tissue disease, haematological disorders, including lymphoma and sarcoid, or may be the result of an immune complex-mediated process. No metal or polyethylene wear particles were seen in skin or synovial tissue. A computed tomography scan showed abnormal soft tissue eroding most of the acromion, no loosening of the prosthesis, a large adjacent fluid collection, with multiple known enlarged subpectoral and axillary lymph nodes. A firststage revision arthroplasty removed the Epocca prosthesis, inserting a temporary cement ball. There was no evidence of metallosis or prosthetic stem loosening, and the titanium components were not exposed. As a second stage, a Delta reverse cobalt and chrome TSR with a polyethylene insert was fitted. Suitable replacements all contained cobalt. The pseudolymphomatous rash started to subside soon after the TSR was removed. Three weeks after stage 2 movement and pain had improved. Fifteen months later he had a full range of movement, and the pain, rash and systemic symptoms had resolved. In a review of 238 noninfective implant-related complications, four with TSR, none of 26 with skin involvement had positive patch tests. In the others, positive tests were seen to cobalt in 2 9%, chrome 1 7%, aluminium 0 4%, titanium salts 0% and nobium 1 4% (Furrer S, Scherer Hofmeier K, Grize L, Bircher AJ. Metal hypersensitivity in patients with orthopaedic implant complications-A retrospective clinical study. Contact Dermatitis 2018; 79: 91-8). We present a case of a local pseudolymphomatous and systemic reaction to a failed shoulder prosthesis, initially imitating an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.

N2  - Introduction: Shoulder pain secondary to osteoarthritis is a prevalent and progressive condition, affecting patients' functionality and quality of life. The suprascapular nerve innervates nearly 70% of the shoulder joint, and its blockade has been shown to reduce pain and improve range of motion (1). Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of suprascapular peripheral nerve stimulation in a patient with shoulder osteoarthritis. Case Description: 81 yo female with a past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and intractable itching attributed to T-cell rearrangement on chronic prednisone presents with severe right shoulder pain for a duration of 20+ years. She endorses a VAS 10/10, localized over the anterolateral and posterior shoulder joint with limited range of motion. Shoulder XR demonstrated severe glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis (Fig. 1). The patient did not respond to a glenohumeral joint intra-articular steroid injection and was hesitant to proceed with additional steroid injections given her history of chronic prednisone use and concern for glenohumeral head osteonecrosis. Total right shoulder arthroplasty was recommended by the orthopedic surgery team, but the patient was hesitant to proceed with major surgery. We performed a suprascapular nerve block under ultrasound guidance with >80% reduction in pain. Patient then opted to trial a suprascapular nerve stimulator under combined fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance, which resulted in dramatic improvement in pain and recovery of functional capacity (Fig. 2, 3). The patient was then scheduled for a permanent implant. Conclusion: Osteoarthritis is the most frequent cause of disability in the United States, with shoulder osteoarthritis affecting up to 32.8% of patients over the age of 60 years (2). Conventional pharmacotherapy and intra-articular steroid injections are first-line treatments but not uncommonly abandoned due to intolerable side effects (3). Physical therapy may also be poorly tolerated given persistent pain and decreased function with disease progression. Moreover, a subset of patients may not be surgical candidates given significant comorbidities. Suprascapular nerve blockade has widely been shown to reduce pain and improve range of motion in patients with shoulder pain. Our patient, who failed conservative therapies and was not a candidate for continued intraarticular steroid injections nor invasive joint replacement, had dramatic improvement in pain, range of motion, and functional capacity following suprascapular nerve stimulator placement. While long-term effectiveness is yet to be determined, suprascapular PNS may be a suitable treatment for shoulder pain secondary to osteoarthritis.

N2  - Purpose: Sickle cell disease is often associated with osteonecrosis of the humeral head with a risk of progression to humeral head collapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and the effect on the necrosis evolution of humeral head core decompression with autologous bone marrow aspirate injection in these patients. Methods: Forty shoulders in 23 patients were treated with core decompression with autologous concentrated iliac crest bone marrow aspirate injection. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years (limits from 2 to 10 years). Functional outcomes metrics included the simple shoulder test (STT) and subjective shoulder value (SSV) as well as assessment of radiographic progression of disease. Results: Shoulder function improved significantly at final follow-up. The STT improved by 2.9 points (p = 0.001) and the SVV improved by 15 % (p = 0.001). However, based on radiologic features, the intervention did not halt the radiographic progression of disease nor did it result in healing of the lesion. The benefits were mainly clinical with diminished pain and functional improvement. Conclusion: Improvement in shoulder function was observed following core decompression and bone marrow aspirate injection in patients with sickle cell disease and early humeral head necrosis stages. The procedure should not be considered for grade 3 or greater disease and for asymptomatic cases whatever the grade. Given the lack of radiographic improvement observed in this study, further study in the context of prospective controlled trials should be undertaken before this intervention can be widely recommended.

N2  - Background: Shoulder arthroplasty is associated with significant post-operative pain. Interscalene plexus block is the gold standard for pain management in patients undergoing this surgery, however, alternatives are currently being developed. We hypothesized that a combination of anterior suprascapular nerve block and lateral sagittal infraclavicular block would provide effective post-operative analgesia. Primary aims for this study were to document numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score and use of oral morphine equivalents (OMEq) during the first 24 hours after surgery. Secondary aim was to determine the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis. Methods: Twenty patients (ASA physical status I-III) scheduled for shoulder arthroplasty were studied. Four mL ropivacaine 0.5% was administered for the suprascapular nerve block and 15 mL ropivacaine 0.75% for the infraclavicular block. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia. Paracetamol and prolonged-release oxycodone were prescribed as post-operative analgesics. Morphine and oxycodone were prescribed as rescue pain medication. Diaphragm status was assessed by ultrasound. Results: Median NRS (0-10) at 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-operatively were 1, 0, 0, 0 and 3, respectively. NRS at rest during the first 24 post-operative hours was 4 (2.5-4.5 [0-5]), median (IQR [range]). Maximum NRS was 6.5 (5-8 [0-10]) median (IQR [range]). Total OMEq during the first 24 post-operative hours was 52.5 mg (30-60 [26.4-121.5]) median (IQR [range]). Hemidiaphragmatic paralysis was diagnosed in one patient (5%). Conclusions: The combination of suprascapular and infraclavicular nerve block shows an encouraging post-operative analgesic profile and a low risk for hemidiaphragmatic paralysis after total shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Whether positive Cutibacterium acnes cultures during revision shoulder arthroplasty represent true periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), deep tissue inoculant, or laboratory contaminant is a point of substantial controversy. The purpose of this study was to review complications of intravenous antibiotics used for treatment of presumed C acnes shoulder PJI. A study population of 26 patients treated for C acnes PJI with a minimum follow-up of 2 years after operative treatment was established. Complication occurrence and severity were obtained through chart review and phone survey. Sixteen (61.5%) patients experienced a therapeutic complication. Twelve (46.2%) patients experienced a total of 47 antibiotic-associated adverse effects and 10 (38.5%) patients experienced 11 total peripherally inserted central catheter line- associated complications. Female sex carried an increased risk for severe complications (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.5; P=.024). Treatment duration of greater than 6 weeks was a significant predictor for the total number of complications experienced [F(1,23)=5.361; P=.030; adjusted R2=0.189]. Age older than 65 years, treatment duration greater than 6 weeks, and female sex were significant predictors for the number of severe complications [F(3,21)=3.249; P=.042; adjusted R2=0.219]. Treating C acnes infection with intravenous antibiotics carries a substantial risk of adverse events, highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis of shoulder PJI. Further investigations into the efficacy and safety profile of oral antibiotics for shoulder PJI are necessary.

N2  - Case: We present a 62-year-old left-hand-dominant woman with history of renal failure, osteoporosis, and 4-part proximal humerus fracture malunion with subsequent post-traumatic arthritis of the left glenohumeral joint. After conservative treatments failed to relieve her symptoms, the patient underwent stemless total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) because of concerns that her proximal humerus could not accommodate a stemmed implant. At 2 and a half-years postoperative, the patient demonstrated significant improvement of symptoms without signs of radiographic loosening. Conclusion: In the setting of proximal humerus malunion with post-traumatic arthritis, clinical improvement without implant loosening can be achieved with stemless TSA, even in the setting of compromised bone quality.

N2  - Case: We present a case of a physical therapy–induced fracture of the proximal humerus, presumably caused by forceful shoulder flexion and external rotation, after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in a 70-year-old woman with underlying osteopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, long-term glucocorticoid use, and common variable immunodeficiency. Conclusion: This case of a physical therapy–induced greater tuberosity fracture after RTSA presents an example of an early postoperative complication with no impact on eventual successful surgical outcomes. Special consideration should be given to tailor the postoperative rehabilitation after RTSA in patients with increased risk of fractures.

N2  - Background: Interscalene brachial plexus blocks are a common modality used to provide adjunctive pain relief with shoulder replacement surgery. In 2018, the Federal Drug Administration approved the use of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) for such nerve blocks. We sought to evaluate whether this formulation of bupivacaine would provide superior pain relief for shoulder replacement patients over standard bupivacaine alone. Our hypotheses were that in the LB cohort the average postoperative pain score over the first 72 hours would be significantly lower, time to block cessation would be longer, total opioid consumption would be lower, and the average patient satisfaction score regarding their pain management would be higher. Materials and methods: A randomized, double-blinded study was designed comparing primary shoulder replacement surgery after an interscalene block with 25 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine vs. 133 mg of LB with 7.5 mL of 0.5% and 7.5 mL of 0.25% plain bupivacaine. A total of 104 patients were included in the study, with an equal number in each study arm. Patients' visual analog pain scores (VAPS) were followed for their inpatient stay, first 3 full outpatient days, and at a 3-week follow-up. Use of opioid medication was recorded for the same intervals and converted to morphine milligram equivalents. The time to first opioid rescue was documented, as well as the patients' satisfaction with their pain management at both the 3-day and 3-week intervals. Results: No clinically relevant advantage to the use of LB over plain bupivacaine was found. During the second postoperative day, the mean VAPS was 2.4 with LB vs. 3.3 in the standard cohort (P =.0409). The only other statistically significant finding was a higher VAPS with LB during the third full day home compared with standard bupivacaine (4.0 vs. 2.8, respectively, P =.0197). Both of these differences were less than the minimal clinically important difference of 2 for the VAPS. Analysis of the VAPS for the first and third postoperative days, the first and second full days home, and at 3 weeks revealed no significant difference. Similarly, there was no significant difference in time to first opioid rescue, total morphine milligram equivalent use, and patient satisfaction with pain management. Conclusion: When used for an interscalene block to provide adjunctive pain relief in shoulder replacement surgery, the addition of LB to plain bupivacaine provides no additional clinically important benefit to the patient's pain experience over standard bupivacaine.

N2  - Whether shoulder arthroplasty can be performed on an outpatient basis depends on appropriate patient selection. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) following shoulder arthroplasty and to generate predictive models to improve patient selection. This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data using a single institution shoulder arthroplasty registry as well as the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, including subjects undergoing hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), and reverse TSA. Predicted probability of suitability for same-day discharge was calculated from multivariable logistic models for different patient subgroups based on age, comorbidities, and Charlson/Deyo Index scores. A total of 2314 shoulders (2079 subjects) in the institutional registry met inclusion criteria for this study. Younger age, higher body mass index (BMI), male sex, and prior steroid injection were all significantly associated with suitability for discharge, whereas preoperative narcotic use, comorbidities (heart disease and anemia/other blood disease), and Charlson/Deyo Index score of 2 were associated with AEs that might prevent same-day discharge. Compared with TSA, reverse TSA was associated with less suitability for discharge (P=.01). On querying the ACS-NSQIP database, 15,254 patients were identified. Female sex, BMI less than 35 kg/m2, American Society of Anesthesiologists class III/IV, preoperative anemia, functional dependence, low preoperative albumin, and hemiarthroplasty were associated with unsuitability for discharge. Males 55 to 59 years old with no comorbidities nor history of narcotic use formed the lowest risk subgroup. Transfusion is the primary driver of AEs. Strategies to avoid this complication should be explored. Risk stratification will improve the ability to identify patients who can safely undergo outpatient shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Histoplasma capsulatum causes pneumonia and multisystemic disease in humans. Musculoskeletal involvement in histoplasmosis is most often tenosynovitis and rarely septic arthritis. Even more uncommon is the involvement of prosthetic joints. Here, we report a series of 3 cases of prosthetic joint failures caused by infection due to H capsulatum. Together with a review of 4 previously reported cases, we summarize host characteristics, clinical presentation, surgical approaches, antifungal management, and outcomes of this rare orthopedic joint infection.

N2  - Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has evolved over the years and is used for a variety of indications, with arthritis being the most common. Stemless TSA is a unique bone-preserving design that can eliminate rotational malalignment. Additionally, recent literature has found utility in the use of biological mesh and a platelet-rich plasma injection to improve healing. The purpose of this article is to outline the process of TSA using a stemless system and how to incorporate the use of amnion matrix and platelet-rich plasma into the surgical technique.

N2  - Background Axillary artery injury secondary to proximal humerus fracture is a rare but serious complication. The management of this injury has traditionally involved surgical treatment. Case summary A 66-year-old female with gait disturbance slipped and fell off her wheelchair at home. She presented to a local hospital with right shoulder pain and was subsequently urgently transferred to our hospital by helicopter because of suspicion of axillary artery injury. Computed tomography angiography revealed disruption of the right axillary artery. We decided to perform endovascular treatment instead of surgical treatment for axillary artery injury. However, since endovascular treatment via the right femoral artery was impossible, we performed bidirectional (right femoral and right brachial artery approaches) endovascular treatment. We expanded the occluded lesion using a 3.5 mm × 40 mm sized balloon and placed a 5.0 mm × 50 mm stent graft (GoreVR ViabahnVR ) across the lesion. The final subclavian injection confirmed that distal flow to the brachial artery was preserved and that there was no leakage of contrast medium from the axillary artery. Discussion We performed endovascular treatment for axillary artery injury secondary to proximal humerus fracture. Although surgical repair is typically performed for this kind of injury, our experience suggests that endovascular treatment might be an option in patients with axillary artery injury.

N2  - Background: Septic arthritis following intra-articular infiltrations is an uncommon devastating complication correlated to high costs for the health service and often to poor outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess a 17-years experience in a single academic multispecialist hospital managing this uncommon complication in Orthopaedic practice. Methods: Patients with diagnosis of septic arthritis following joint injections treated in our hospital from January 2002 to December 2019 were included in the study. Clinical and demographic data, pathogens, injected agent, conservative/surgical treatments were reviewed. Patient were classified according to the ore operative Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Cierny-Mader Classification(CMC). Furthermore follow-up outcome and time occurred to infection eradication were registered. Results: We included in the study 11 patients with a median age of 74 years old (IQR= 61.5-79). The median CCI was 3 (IQR= 2-5) and the majority of patients belong to CMC = B class. Septic arthritis occurred mainly following corticosteroids injections and more frequently involving knees. The pathogen more often isolated was Staphylococcus aureus. Five (45%) patients referred an history of multiple intra-articular in-jections. 7 patients (64%) had a complete resolution following an arthroscopic debridement, 4 (36%) patients underwent to a 2-stage replacement and one of them hesitated in an arthrodesis because of a recurrent periprosthetic joint infection and extensor apparatus insufficiency. Conclusion: The authors observed a potential increased risk of septic arthritis following joint injection in patients with history of multiple injections and poor health/immunological conditions. They recommend an early arthroscopic debridement as the treatment of choice especially in septic knees performed in a multispecialist dedicated center. (www.actabiomedica.it).

N2  - Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether liposomal bupivacaine (LB) single-injection could achieve an analgesic effect similar to that of continuous local anesthetic nerve blocks (CNBs) after painful surgeries. Methods: Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases were comprehensively searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a modified Jadad score ≥ 4 compared LB single-injection with CNBs in patients after painful surgeries were included. The primary outcomes were VAS pain score and opioid consumption. The secondary outcomes were complications and length of hospital stay. Review Manager 5.3 and trial sequential analysis (TSA) 0.9.5.10 were used to analyze the extracted data. Results: Six RCTs of 625 patients were included for meta-analysis. Both groups in 5 RCTs described standard concomitant treatment with multimodal analgesia. There were no significant differences in mean VAS scores for postoperative day 0 (P = 0.12), day 1 (P = 0.18), and day 2 (P = 0.41); highest VAS scores for day 0 (P = 0.18), day 1 (P = 0.46), and day 2 (P = 0.18); total opioid consumption for day 0 (P = 0.05), day 1 (P = 0.28), and day 2 (P = 0.57); complications (P = 0.30); and length of hospital stay (P = 0.64) between the 2 groups. TSA of primary outcomes showed that all cumulative Z curves failed to cross the TSA boundary and did not reach the required information size. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that LB single-injection and CNBs have similar efficacy of pain relief and safety in patients after painful surgeries when concomitant with multimodal analgesia. However, the results of TSA indicate that further trials are still needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Purpose: Scapular stress fracture (sSF) is a difficult complication to treat after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and possible risk factors in a large population. Methods: A total of 2165 RSAs that were implanted between January 2006 and October 2017 in five hospitals were evaluated. Within this cohort, sSF was radiologically confirmed. Age, gender, surgical indication and hospital of treatment were determined for the entire cohort. A matched 3:1 case-control study was then performed to investigate several clinical and surgical variables. Results: sSF occurred in 3.1% (63 patients), with a median time interval of five months post-operative [IQR = 9, range: (1–79)]. Within the entire cohort, females (OR = 2.99) and rotator cuff arthropathy (RCA) (OR = 2.79) were more prone to this complication. Age had little influence (OR = 1.03). After exclusion, fifty-five eligible cases were matched to 165 controls based on hospital, gender, age and surgical indication. After univariable analysis, significance was obtained for osteopenia (P = 0.037), osteoporosis (P = 0.032), surgical approach (P = 0.002) and peri-operative acromioclavicular (AC) joint surgery (P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that osteopenia (OR = 3.94), osteoporosis (OR = 2.85) and a deltopectoral approach (OR = 3.70) were independent risk factors. Conclusion: According to our findings, older women with poor bone quality and a history of RCA suffered more frequently from sSF. Anterolateral approach during surgery was a surgical protective factor, possibly due to the mobilization of the acromioclavicular joint. Although this study indicates who is at risk for sSF, further investigation for prevention of sSF in these patients is necessary.

N2  - Background: Brachial plexus injects are common procedures for pain management of the upper limb. Complications from theses injections, however, can be severe leading to permanent neurological deficit. The purpose of this technical report is to introduces a safe novel approach for brachial plexus injections. Case Presentation: A 45-year-old woman with type 2 complex region pain disorder underwent a novel brachial plexus injec-tion. The patient was brought to the operating room where fluoroscopy was used to locate the T2 lamina. A 17-gauge introducer needle was maneuvered through the interlaminar space and into the epidural space. The stylet was removed and a Brevi Kath® (Epimed, Dallas, TX) was passed through the C7-T1 foramen into the brachial plexus region. Contrast was used to ensure proper placement and absence of vascular pickup. The injection was then given, and the catheter withdrawn. The procedure was done without complication and the patient had a 40% reduction in pain symptoms based on a visual analog scale. She was cleared to restart physical therapy. Conclusions: This novel technique approaches the brachial plexus by gaining access to the thoracic epidural space and following the spinal nerves through their respective foramen. The use of fluoroscopy and contrast ensures correct placement of injection. A blunt catheter limits the risk of injury. This approach may benefit patients who have failed standard techniques using local landmarks or those that are not ideal candidates due to previous injury or pre-existing conditions.

N2  - Background: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty normally has adequate functional outcomes in patients with cuff tear arthropathy. The present study aimed to investigate the midterm clinical outcomes of reverse shoulder arthroplasty in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Between July 2014 and May 2016, reverse shoulder arthroplasty was performed in 14 rheumatic shoulders with joint destruction and rotator cuff tears. The range of motion, Constant score, and Shoulder36, which is a patient-reported outcome measure, were compared preoperatively and postoperatively. The prevalence of subscapular notching, subscapular osteophytes, postoperative fractures, and stress shielding of the humeral stem were evaluated by X-ray. Results: Range of motion significantly improved from 77 to 122 degrees in flexion and from 67 to 111 degrees in abduction at four years. The Constant score significantly improved from 27 to 62, and each domain of Shoulder36 also significantly increased at four years. There was no dislocation, infection, or loosening of the prosthesis. Three shoulders presented scapular notching, and three cemented humeral stems showed stress shielding in the proximal humeral cortical bone. Conclusion: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty performed in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis not only decreased the pain and improved the function of the shoulder joint but also significantly improved patients’ health and activity of daily living in midterm results.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have shown good clinical outcomes in patients with irreparable large or massive rotator cuff tears treated using arthroscopic partial repair (APR); however, few studies have evaluated both functional and structural outcomes in these patients. Purpose: To evaluate both functional and structural outcomes in patients with large or massive rotator cuff tears treated using APR. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between March 2009 and November 2016, a total of 30 patients underwent APR because of the irreparability of their large or massive rotator cuff tears during surgery. Of these patients, 24 completed the minimum 24-month follow-up (mean, 61.8 ± 27.1 months; range, 24-112 months) and were included in this study. Functional outcome measures included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) scores and the visual analog scale for pain. Structural outcome measures comprised preoperative fatty degeneration, mediolateral tear size, residual tendon attachment area, and glenohumeral (GH) arthritic changes evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging scans or plain radiographs before and after surgery. Functional and structural outcomes were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. Results: The JOA scores for all patients significantly improved from 67.9 ± 11.3 preoperatively to 85.4 ± 15.6 postoperatively (P <.0001). Similarly, the UCLA scores significantly improved from 15.8 ± 4.20 preoperatively to 29 ± 6.69 at final follow-up postoperatively (P <.0001). The mediolateral tear size were significantly decreased at 3 months postoperatively (P <.001) and at the final follow-up (P <.001). Compared with preoperative scores, the novel score evaluating the residual tendon attachment area improved from 3.08 ± 0.46 to 3.54 ± 0.41 (P <.001) after surgery overall, although it significantly deteriorated from 3 months postoperatively to the final follow-up. GH osteoarthritis progressed in 6 patients (25%). Patients who developed osteoarthritis had lower JOA and UCLA scores than did those who did not (JOA, P =.010; UCLA, P =.037). Conclusion: In irreparable large or massive rotator cuff tears treated using APR, functional outcome improved after surgery. Although the residual tendon attachment area improved, functional outcome after APR corresponded to the GH alterations at the midterm follow-up. Longer-term follow-up is needed to further elucidate the effect of APR on clinical outcomes in these patients.

N2  - Introduction: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) procedures are becoming increasingly more common. While the main complications are known, the management of clavicle fractures in patients with an ipsilateral RTSA is not well described. There are three case studies that document clavicular stress fractures following RTSA with an atraumatic etiology, and to our knowledge, no studies have described a traumatic clavicular fracture following RTSA. Case: We describe the case of a 75-year-old woman with a traumatic clavicle fracture five years after RTSA for rotator cuff tear arthropathy. With minimal pain and subjective symptoms initially, the patient wished to pursue non-operative treatment. However, she eventually developed a painful non-union and pseudoparalysis of the shoulder with serial radiographs demonstrating progressive superior scapular tilting and scapular notching. Subsequent open reduction internal fixation of her clavicle fracture significantly improved her pain and function. Conclusion: We report a traumatic clavicle fracture in the setting of RTSA that not only failed to heal but also resulted in scapular notching and shoulder pseudoparalysis that was improved with surgical stabilization of the fracture. It is possible that the setting of a semi-constrained RTSA, the resulting biomechanical imbalance may predispose to impaired fracture healing and non-union of the clavicle fracture.

N2  - Objective: Recent reports have shown that outpatient shoulder arthroplasty (SA) may be a safe alternative to inpatient management in appropriately selected patients. The purpose was to review the literature reporting on outpatient SA. Methods: A systematic review of publications on outpatient SA was performed. Included publications discussed patients who were discharged on the same calendar day or within 23 hours from surgery. Articles were categorized by discussions on complications, readmissions, and safety, patient selection, pain management strategies, cost effectiveness, and patient and surgeon satisfaction. Results: Twenty-six articles were included. Patients undergoing outpatient SA were younger and with a lower BMI than those undergoing inpatient SA. Larger database studies reported more medical complications for patients undergoing inpatient compared to outpatient SA. Articles on pain management strategies discussed both single shot and continuous interscalene blocks with similar outcomes. Both patients and surgeons reported high levels of satisfaction following outpatient SA, and cost analysis studies demonstrated significant cost savings for outpatient SA. Conclusion: In appropriately selected patients, outpatient SA can be a safe, cost-saving alternative to inpatient care and may lead to high satisfaction of both patients and physicians, though further studies are needed to clarify appropriate utilization of outpatient SA.

N2  - Introduction: The use of high-flux over cuprophane dialyzers, has led to Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis (B2M) becoming rare in long term hemodialysis (HD) patients. Amyloid fibers embed systemically, skeletal involvement producing bone cysts, tendinopathy and fractures. Case Description: A 65-yo male on chronic HD for 30 years presented with progressive, right (R) shoulder intractable pain and limited range of movement (ROM). X-ray/MRI identified severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA), tendinopathy and large irreparable rotator cuff tear. Past history included heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, hepatitis C, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic anemia. Surgical history included bilateral (b/l) total hip arthroplasties, b/l carpal tunnel release, R nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in renal cystic disease. Due to the intractable pain, disability and failure of physical therapy and corticosteroid injection therapy he underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Operative findings showed large soft tissue deposits about the subscapularis, glenoid and labrum, attributed to amyloid. Histology of intra-articular soft tissue, labrum and synovium confirmed amyloid (apple-green birefringence by Congo Red Staining) with focal calcium pyrophosphate deposition. Undecalcified histology of humeral head showed moderate secondary hyper-parathyroid bone disease with peritrabecular amyloid deposits. Following surgery patient noted marked improvement in pain and partial improvement in shoulder ROM. Discussion: No treatment exists for HD patients with B2M, ineligible for kidney transplant. Physicians are tasked with treating clinical manifestations that severely impact quality of life (QOL). Concern for adverse outcomes and paucity of surgical precedent should not deter appropriate surgical intervention. This patient illustrates the clinical and surgical decision-making targeted to improving (QOL).

N2  - Case Diagnosis: 69-year-old male with shoulder pain and weakness caused by a paralabral cyst-related suprascapular neuropathy was successfully treated with ultrasound-guided aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Case Description: The patient presented for 8 weeks of right shoulder pain and weakness after a day of activity without specific injury. Pain described as sharp, rated 0-10/10, worse with activity. Examination notable for atrophy in the supraspinatus/infraspinatus regions, decreased external rotation strength and active range of motion. MRI demonstrated multilobulated suprascapular/spinoglenoid notch cyst arising from glenoid labral tear causing supraspinatus and infraspinatus denervation change, as well as rotator cuff tendinosis and glenoid cartilage loss. We treated with physical therapy and glenohumeral joint injection. 6-week follow-up revealed improved pain but ongoing weakness causing functional limitation. EMG confirmed suprascapular neuropathy with severe denervation changes to infraspinatus, mild changes to supraspinatus. Neurosurgical and orthopedic surgery consults recommended against surgical decompression due to pain improvement, consideration of percutaneous cyst aspiration, and future reverse total shoulder arthroplasty if symptoms worsened. Setting: Tertiary care hospital Assessment/Results: Using ultrasound guidance, the complex cyst was confirmed, each chamber was fenestrated and aspirated, and anesthetic/corticosteroid was injected into the cyst and posterior glenohumeral joint. At 1-month follow-up, patient reported resolution of pain, 90% improvement in strength and function. After 1 year, patient reported 2 flares of pain and occasional mild fatigue-type weakness, and requested a repeat procedure. Discussion: Shoulder paralabral cysts may cause suprascapular neuropathy, an etiology that accounts for 1-4% of shoulder pain cases and is often underdiagnosed. MRI and EMG are used to confirm the diagnosis. Referral for more invasive treatments may be considered after conservative methods have failed. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of a paralabral cyst may provide effective relief for patients not amenable to surgery. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the utility of ultrasound-guided paralabral cyst aspiration in a patient with suprascapular neuropathy causing functional limitation.

N2  - Background: Several studies have evaluated total hip and knee arthroplasty in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients; however, there are limited studies evaluating shoulder arthroplasty in SOT patients. This study compares the complications and functional outcomes of SOT patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty with a matched control group. Methods: The institution's database was retrospectively reviewed for patients with a history of SOT undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty (with minimum 2-year follow-up) and compared with a control group matched for age, sex, preoperative diagnosis, and surgical procedure. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion and outcome scores, perioperative surgical and medical complications, hospital length of stay, and mortality were compared. Results: Fifteen patients with previous SOT underwent 19 shoulder arthroplasties. Thirty-four underwent 35 shoulder arthroplasties in the control group. At last follow-up, the SOT group had a significantly worse UCLA score. The SOT group had a significantly worse improvement in UCLA, active elevation, and passive elevation scores in pre- to postoperative scores. There was no difference in length of stay, infection, or surgical complications. Ninety-day readmissions, medically related complications, and required blood transfusion were significantly higher in the SOT group. There was increased mortality in the SOT compared with the control group (death occurred on average 1577 days after arthroplasty). Conclusion: Shoulder arthroplasty in patients with previous SOT appears safe and effective for degenerative shoulder disorders. Patients should be counseled preoperatively that their range of motion and function may not improve as much as their nontransplant cohorts. SOT patients may have increased incidence of postoperative blood transfusions and medically related complications.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the clinical, biomechanical, and financial impact of the use of subacromial balloon spacers in the surgical management of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears (RCTs). Methods: All studies assessing the use of implantable subacromial balloon spacers for management of massive, irreparable RCTs were systematically searched. Risk of bias was assessed using Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria. Data extraction and analysis was performed for pain and function scores, shoulder range of motion (ROM), glenohumeral contact pressure and vertical migration of humeral head, and cost. Subjective synthesis was performed with forest plots when outcomes were reported in 3 or more studies. Results: In total, 19 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis; 337 patients (mean age 68 years) had 343 subacromial balloon spacer implantations. Throughout a mean follow-up of 33 months, there was significant improvement in the Total Constant Score (preoperative: 22.5-41.8; postoperative: 51.4-72.3), Oxford Shoulder Score (preoperative: 21.3-26; postoperative: 34.39-48.2), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (preoperative: 24.5-59.1; postoperative: 72.5-85.7), and shoulder ROM parameters. Subacromial balloon spacer placement resisted superior humeral head migration (range of preoperative to postoperative difference: 2.8-6.2 mm) and decreased peak subacromial pressure during shoulder ROM. Conclusions: Existing literature of subacromial balloon spacers has a high risk of bias, lack of appropriate control, and low levels of evidence. A qualitative synthesis indicates that subacromial balloon spacer implantation in patients with massive irreparable RCTs is cost-effective and leads to improved function (Total Constant Score and Oxford Shoulder Score) and ROM. In cadaveric studies, subacromial balloon spacers resist superior humeral head migration and reduce subacromial pressure. The theoretical risk of biodegradation of the balloon spacer has not been substantiated in study of up to 5-years follow-up, and the risk of complications from this procedure appears to be minimal. Level of Evidence: IV; Systematic review of level III-IV studies.

N2  - Background: This study compares early postoperative pain control, narcotic usage, and cost in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty with the use of either a single-shot liposomal bupivacaine interscalene nerve block (SS) or a continuous catheter interscalene nerve block (IC). Methods: Two consecutive cohorts of patients undergoing primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty at different centers with different regional anesthesia protocols (SS vs. IC) were reviewed. Outcomes included pain on a numeric rating scale, narcotic consumption in milligram morphine equivalents, hospital length of stay, duration of nerve blockade, and complications. Block-related supply costs and an estimate of anesthesia professional fees are also reported. Results: Among 100 patients evenly divided between SS and IC, the difference in mean numeric rating scale pain scores on postoperative day 0 and 1 was statistically significant in favor of the SS group (1.2 vs. 2.5) but otherwise no difference was noted on postoperative day 2 or 3. There was no difference in milligram morphine equivalents or length of stay. The average duration of the nerve block was 49.8 hours in the SS group, and 84.0 hours in the IC group. SS was less costly than IC regional anesthesia. Conclusion: Liposomal bupivacaine used for a single shot interscalene nerve block is as effective as an indwelling catheter for controlling postoperative pain after shoulder arthroplasty. In our system, SS was more cost effective. Level of evidence: Level III; Retrospective Cohort Design; Treatment Study

N2  - Cases:Two patients presented to different surgeons complaining of persistent shoulder pain after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Workups for fracture, instability, and periprosthetic infection were negative. Advanced imaging, nerve conduction studies, and diagnostic injections localized symptoms to the suprascapular nerve. Revision arthroplasty with removal of the offending screws improved pain in both patients.Conclusion:Suprascapular nerve irritation because of the malposition of baseplate screws in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty can be a source of postoperative pain. Removal of the offending screw without formal nerve exploration may result in symptomatic improvement.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This review aims to describe the role of the latissimus dorsi transfer (LDT) for patients with irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears (RCTs). Recent Findings: Historically, the LDT has been performed as an open (double-incision) procedure for neurologically intact, relatively young patients with irreparable posterosuperior RCTs with disabling loss of active external rotation with or without impaired active elevation. The transferred tendon reconstitutes the posterior rotator cuff and force couple, respectively and thus has the potential to function effectively as an external rotator and humeral head depressor. Long-term results of the open technique have demonstrated in the majority of patients substantial and durable improvements in shoulder function and pain relief at the 10-year benchmark. With the advancements of arthroscopic surgery, the LDT was expanded to an arthroscopically assisted procedure with promising short-term results. In addition to adequate technical performance, the success of the procedure depends on preoperative factors, such as exclusion of glenohumeral osteoarthritis and acromial acetabularization; intact or reparable subscapularis tendon; intact (or hypertrophic) teres minor muscle; adequate preoperative activity of the latissimus dorsi; and normal or mild impairment of overhead function. Summary: The LDT (open or arthroscopically assisted) is a reliable treatment option for patients with massive, irreparable posterosuperior RCTs with disabling loss of active external rotation, with or without diminished overhead function and without advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Precise patient selection is of tremendous importance in the success of the LDT.

N2  - Purpose of the Review: Functionally irreparable rotator cuff tears (FIRCTs) remain one of the most challenging pathologies treated in the shoulder. The lower trapezius transfer represents a very promising treatment option for posterosuperior FIRCT. This article reviews the role for the lower trapezius transfer in the treatment of patient with FIRCTs and highlights the tips and tricks to performing this arthroscopic-assisted procedure. Recent Findings: The treatment of posterosuperior FIRCTs contemplates a wide array of surgical options, including partial repair, biceps tenodesis/tenotomy, superior capsule reconstruction, subacromial balloon, reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and open-/arthroscopic-assisted tendon transfers. Tendon transfers have emerged as very promising reconstructive options to rebalance the anterior-posterior force couple. Controversy remains regarding the relative indications of latissimus dorsi transfer (LDT) and lower trapezius transfer (LTT). Initially used with very good success in patients with brachial plexus injuries, the open LTT has shown excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes in a recent series of patients with FIRCTs. However, this technique should be reserved for patients with an intact or reparable subscapularis tendon and no advanced glenohumeral arthritis or humeral head femoralization. With advancements in surgical technique, the arthroscopic-assisted LTT has shown similar promising results. However, studies on arthroscopically assisted LTT are limited to short-term follow-up, and future comparative trials with large patient numbers and longer follow-up are needed to better understand the indications for this novel tendon transfer in the treatment of FIRCT. Summary: The arthroscopic-assisted LTT is a novel, promising option for the treatment of patients with functional irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears. Careful attention to indications and technical pearls are paramount when performing this procedure to optimize postoperative clinical outcomes.

N2  - Background: Most studies on Cutibacterium acnes in shoulder surgery have been conducted in the Western population, and studies on Asians are rare. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors of C acnes in shoulder arthroplasty in Asians. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 154 patients between January 2017 and May 2019 who underwent shoulder arthroplasty. Swabs were taken after skin preparation from the skin surface of the anterior acromion, axilla, and joint fluid to study the incidence of C acnes. Before skin preparation we also collected swabs from the anterior acromion, axilla, and thigh from 59 of the 154 patients. Results: Eight of 154 patients after and 6 of 59 patients before skin preparation were positive for C acnes. C acnes were found in 2 patients at the anterior acromion and in 6 at the synovial joint after skin preparation and in 1 patient at the axilla, in 5 at the anterior acromion, and in 3 at the thigh before preparation. History of steroid injection and number of steroid injections were significantly associated with C acnes isolation (P = .039 and P = .006, respectively), whereas age, sex, body mass index, shoulder surgery history, hypertension, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease were not, as were serum inflammatory markers, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Conclusion: A total of 5.2% of the patients after skin preparation and 10.2% of patients before skin preparation were found to be positive for C acnes. The incidence of C acnes in patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasties in Asia was low and, thus, ethnic differences should be considered for C acnes. The history and number of steroid injections were associated with isolation of C acnes.

N2  - The humeral head is the second most common site for nontraumatic osteonecrosis after the femoral head, yet it has attracted relatively little attention. Osteonecrosis is associated with many conditions, such as traumatism, corticosteroid use, sickle cell disease, alcoholism, dysbarism (or caisson disease), and Gaucher's disease. The diagnosis is clinical and radiographic with MRI, with radiographs being the basis for staging. Many theories have been proposed to decipher the mechanism behind the development of osteonecrosis, but none have been proven. Because osteonecrosis may affect patients with a variety of risk factors, it is important that caregivers have a heightened index of suspicion. Early detection may affect prognosis because prognosis is dependent on the stage and location of the disease. In particular, the disease should be suspected in patients with a history of fractures, steroid usage, or sickle cell disease, and in divers. This report reviews osteonecrosis of the humeral head, with an emphasis on causes, clinical evaluation, imaging, and classification.

N2  - Background: The shoulder region is a common area for pain. The shoulder has the largest range of motion and the most complex mechanical anatomy. The shoulder girdle and related tendons allow for numerous painful disorders to occur. Also, given the overall use of the shoulder, arthritic deformities are all too common. Finally, pain from more complex states such as poststroke shoulder pain and status post total shoulder arthroplasty pain have always been a difficult diagnosis to treat with effectiveness. The innervation to the shoulder predominantly comes from the suprascapular and axillary nerves. Both nerves relatively follow an expected anatomic course and whereby they can be targeted with ultrasound or fluoroscopy. Recently, there has been an increase in evidence that suggests peripheral nerve stimulation can make a difference in these patients with shoulder pain. Objectives: To provide a basic overview of peripheral nerve stimulator placement targeting the axillary and suprascapular nerves. Furthermore, to demonstrate the suggested implantation and current evidence of peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of shoulder pain. Study Design: Anatomic clinical review. Methods: A comprehensive review was performed regarding the available literature through targeting articles reporting on the use of peripheral nerve stimulation to treat pain of the shoulder region. Results: We compiled and discuss the current evidence available in treating shoulder pain utilizing peripheral stimulation. The strongest evidence currently is for peripheral nerve stimulation targeting either the axillary or suprascapular nerve, as well as placement targeting the motor points of the deltoid. The most common treated pathology is poststroke shoulder pain. Limitations: Peripheral nerve stimulation has been trialed and is promising for several shoulder pain pathologies; however, there remains a need for large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials to further evaluate the efficacy of most treatments. Much of the current data relies on case reports without randomization or placebo controls. Conclusions: Overall there is fair to moderate evidence for peripheral nerve stimulation to treat shoulder pain in hemiplegic poststroke patients. There is limited evidence when treating other shoulder pain etiologies. Utilizing ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance, the procedure has proven to be safe allowing proper placement of the electrodes near the target nerves. Considering the high prevalence of shoulder pain from degenerative conditions and overuse, future studies are undoubtedly warranted to evaluate whether peripheral nerve stimulation can modify our treatment algorithm for management of these conditions.

N2  - Background: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is an increasingly common procedure. This study looked at trends in TSA using a nationwide registry, with a focus on patient demographics, comorbidities, and complications. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who underwent TSA from 2005 to 2018. Cohorts were created based on year of surgery: 2005-2010 (N = 1116), 2011-2014 (N = 5920), and 2015-2018 (N = 16,717). Patient demographics, comorbidities, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge location, and complications within 30 days of surgery were compared between cohorts using bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Bivariate analysis revealed significantly more comorbidities among patients in the 2015-2018 cohort compared with the 2005-2010 cohort, specifically American Society of Anesthesiologist class III or IV (57.0% vs. 44.3%, P <.001), morbid obesity (10.8% vs. 7.8%, P <.001), diabetes (17.8% vs. 12.1%, P <.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.7% vs. 4.1%, P =.003). The use of regional anesthesia has decreased (5.6% in 2005-2010 vs. 2.8% in 2015-2018, P <.001), as has operative time (▵: −16 minutes, P <.001) and length of stay (▵: −0.6 days, P <.001). There were also significant decreased rates of perioperative blood transfusion (OR [odds ratio], 0.46), non-home discharge (OR, 0.79), urinary tract infection (OR, 0.47), and sepsis (OR, 0.17), (P <.001 for all comparisons) between the 2005-2010 and 2015-2018 cohorts. Conclusions: Between 2005 and 2018, patients undergoing TSA had increasingly more comorbidities but experienced lower rates of short-term complications, in the context of shorter hospitalizations and more frequent discharge to home.

N2  - Introduction: Critical shoulder angle (CSA) has been shown to influence rates of rotator cuff tears and glenohumeral arthritis with a larger CSA associated with rotator cuff tears and a smaller CSA associated with glenohumeral arthritis. There has been no study to determine whether such radiographic measurement influences the function of patients with demonstrated cuff tear arthropathy (CTA). The purpose of this study was to examine whether smaller CSAs were associated with greater range of motion (ROM) in patients diagnosed with CTA. Materials and methods: Ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of CTA with adequate anteroposterior shoulder radiographs were included in the study. Patient demographics were recorded. The presence of a rotator cuff tear was confirmed via advanced imaging or when applicable via the operative report. Patients' ROM was evaluated through the physician's office note. Shoulder radiographs were used to measure CSA, glenoid inclination, acromial index (AI), and acromiohumeral interval. Patient ROM was measured and grouped into 2 different tiered cohorts: cohort 1 had 4 subgroups of forward elevation (FE) (ie, ≤45°, 45°-90°, 91°-135°, and 136°-180°) and cohort 2 had 2 subgroups of FE (ie, ≤90° and >90°). We then analyzed FE between these groups in the context of their radiographic measurements. Results: The average patient age was 73.8 ± 8.0 years. There was no significant difference in acromiohumeral interval. AI was found to be significantly different between patients presenting with ≤90° in FE compared with those >90° (P =.02). Average CSA was significantly lower in patients with FE greater than 90° at 33.7° ± 3.9° compared with patients with FE less than 90° at 37.1° ± 6.3° (P =.002). There was also a significant difference with regard to CSAs, with those patients with FE ≤ 45° having a mean CSA of 38.2° ± 8.3° compared with those patients with FE ≥ 135° having a mean CSA of 33.3° ± 4.3° (P =.02). Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with CTA can significantly vary in their shoulder function and ability to forward elevate. Lower CSA was found to be associated with higher FE in patients with CTA preoperatively. In addition, patients with a smaller AI were also found to have better overhead function. Analyzing CSA on plain radiographs may help manage functional expectations in patients with CTA.

N2  - Background: Locking plate technology has increased the frequency of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of proximal humerus fractures (PHF). A number of technical pearls have been recommended to lower the complication rate of ORIF. These pearls are particularly relevant for patients aged >60 years, when nonoperative treatment and arthroplasty are alternatives commonly considered. There have been few large, single-center studies on the modern application of this technology. Methods: Between 2005 and 2015, a total of 173 PHFs in patients aged >60 years were treated at our institution with ORIF using locking plates. Failure was defined as reoperation or radiographic evidence of failure. Average follow-up was 6.1 years. Results: There was an overall complication rate of 44%. The overall failure rate was 34% and correlated with fracture type: 26% failure rate in 2-part fractures (16 failures), 39% in 3-part fractures (23 failures), and 45% in 4-part fractures (11 failures). There was no difference between the failure rate with and without fibular allograft (33% vs. 34%). Most patients with radiographic or clinical failure did not undergo reoperation. The overall reoperation rate was 11% (14 patients). Seven percent of 2-part fractures (4 shoulders), 14% of 3-part fractures (8 shoulders), and 18% of 4-part fractures (2 shoulders) required reoperation. Conclusions: ORIF of PHFs with locking plates in patients aged >60 years resulted in a 44% complication and 34% failure rate. There was a trend toward higher complication and failure rates in older patients and more complex fractures. Refinement in fixation techniques and indications are necessary to optimize the surgical management of PHFs.

N2  - Background:The possibility of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) replacing interscalene blockade (ISB) as an integral component of a multimodal clinical pathway for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) needs to be further investigated. We thus further designed a randomized controlled study to compare LIA with ISB in the treatment of TSA.Methods:This blinded and randomised study was performed after approval of the institutional review board in the first affiliated hospital of Jinan University. The included patients were all aged over 18 years and underwent shoulder arthroplasty because of osteoarthritis of the shoulder. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups as follows: LIA or ISB. The primary outcome of this noninferiority study is opioid consumption within the first 24hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, length of hospital stay, complication, and satisfaction score. P value<.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:For the present trial, we hypothesized that there would be no difference in pain score levels and opioid medication use throughout admission.Trial registration:This study protocol was registered in Research Registry (researchregistry5640).

N2  - Case:A 78-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and a massive rotator cuff tear of the right shoulder was treated with reverse shoulder arthroplasty, but a pseudoaneurysm in the posterior humeral circumflex artery suddenly ruptured 7 months after surgery. Embolization of the pseudoaneurysm and skin treatment successfully relieved her symptoms without implant removal.Conclusion:Although a rare occurrence, vascular complication can occur after shoulder arthroplasty. The cause of the pseudoaneurysm was hypothesized to be repetitive contact between the humeral component and the artery and/or chronic traction of the blood vessel because of its chronic onset.

N2  - Background: Neurologic problems after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) have been reported, but there are a lack of studies regarding which nerve(s) are damaged and the outcomes for the patients who had neurologic complications after RTSA. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and outcomes of neurologic deficit after RTSA and to evaluate the correlation between nonanatomic rearrangement of the shoulder joint and neurologic complications after RTSA. We hypothesized that the neurologic deficit was associated with excessive distalization or lateralization of the humerus after RTSA. Methods: RTSA was performed on 182 consecutive shoulders with cuff tear arthropathy. Comparative analysis was performed on 34 shoulders with (group 1) and 148 shoulders without (group 2) neurologic deficit. Results: The mean follow-up period in the study was 58.5 months (range: 24-124). The mean age was 71.5 ± 7.7 years in group 1 and 73.1 ± 7.2 years in group 2. Neurologic deficit after RTSA was found in 34 shoulders (19%). The mean postoperative acromiohumeral distance was 34.1 ± 11.0 mm in group 1 and 29.4 ± 7.6 mm in group 2 (P = .015). Significant differences in terms of postoperative distalization of the humerus were seen between group 1 (24.5 ± 9.4 mm) and group 2 (20.5 ± 8.3 mm) (P = .009). The most common forms of neurologic deficit after RTSA were axillary nerve (41.2%) and radial nerve (15%) injuries. Thirty shoulders (88%) had neuropraxia, and 4 shoulders (12%) had axonotmesis. By conservative treatment, all patients with neurologic complications achieved complete recovery without any additional surgery; the mean recovery period was 7.4 months (range: 2-38 months). Conclusion: Neurologic deficit occurred in 19% of patients who underwent RTSA, and it was significantly correlated with humeral distalization after surgery. Axillary nerve was mostly involved, and all patients with neurologic deficit achieved complete recovery without any additional surgery.

N2  - Background: Optimal modalities for pain control in shoulder arthroplasty are not yet established. Although regional nerve blockade has been a well-accepted modality, complications and rebound pain have led some surgeons to seek other pain control modalities. Local injection of anesthetics has recently gained popularity in joint arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and complication rate of a low-cost local anesthetic injection mixture for use in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) compared with interscalene brachial plexus blockade. Methods: A total of 314 patients underwent TSA and were administered general anesthesia with either a local injection mixture (local infiltration anesthesia [LIA], n = 161) or peripheral nerve block (PNB, n = 144). Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed for postoperative pain scores, 24-hour opioid consumption, and 90-day postoperative complications. Results: Immediate postoperative pain scores were not significantly different between groups (P =.94). The LIA group demonstrated a trend toward lower pain scores at 24 hours postoperatively (P =.10). Opioid consumption during the first 24 hours following surgery was significantly reduced in the LIA group compared with the PNB group (P <.0001). There was a trend toward fewer postoperative nerve and cardiopulmonary complications in the LIA group than the PNB group (P =.22 and P =.40, respectively) Conclusion: Periarticular local injection mixtures provide comparable pain control to regional nerve blocks while reducing opioid use and postoperative complications following TSA. Local injection of a multimodal anesthetic solution is a viable option for pain management in TSA.

N2  - Background: The creation of pain as the fifth vital sign led to skyrocketing opioid prescriptions and a crisis with addiction and abuse among Americans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient engagement model including education and innovative opioid-free multimodal pain management to achieve an opioid-free recovery after shoulder arthroplasty (SA). Methods: Fifty patients undergoing SA were divided into 2 groups. In the opioid-free group (OFG), patients received additional preoperative education in combination with an innovative non-opioid multimodal pain management protocol and non-opioid alternatives. Patients were compared regarding pain levels and opioid consumption at 48 hours and at 2 weeks, as well as patient-reported outcome measures, using Student t tests. Results: No significant differences were found in age (average, 69.76 years) (P =.14), American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (average, 2.25) (P =.24), sex, body mass index (average, 29.5) (P =.34), or comorbidity burden. In the OFG, 24% of patients reported use of rescue opioids (<2 pills) within the first 48 hours after surgery with complete cessation by 2 weeks postoperatively. Comparatively, in the control group, 100% of patients reported using opioids in the first 48 hours after surgery and 80% reported still taking opioids at 2 weeks postoperatively. Patients in both groups showed significant improvements in outcome scores (P ≤.05), with the OFG reporting significantly higher American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons pain (P =.036) and Constant (P =.005) scores. Conclusions: Our findings support complete elimination of opioid use by 2 weeks after SA using a patient engagement model with non–opioid-based alternative pain management. The elimination of opioid pain management did not diminish outcomes or patient satisfaction after SA.

N2  - Imaging evaluation of the shoulder is performed using multiple modalities, including ultrasound (US) and MR imaging. Clinicians often wonder which modality to use to work up their patients with shoulder pain. Although MR imaging has remained the workhorse of shoulder imaging, US has increased in popularity among academic and private institutions. Both modalities offer similar diagnostic information in regards to rotator cuff pathology and other soft tissues, although they differ in their technique, indications, and interpretation. A thorough understanding of these differences is imperative to appropriately use these modalities in clinical practice, including the unique interventional opportunities available with US.

N2  - Background: Shoulder joint aspirations are frequently performed to rule out infection. In case of unsuccessful aspiration, physicians often augment the aspiration liquid by injecting saline solution. Methods: We performed shoulder joint aspirations by fluoroscopic assistance and analyzed the value of an additional saline solution irrigation in patients undergoing revision shoulder surgery. Native joints and post–fracture repair, post-arthroscopy, and post-arthroplasty shoulders were included. A minimum of 3 deep intraoperative tissue samples served as the microbiological gold standard. Results: We performed 106 aspirations occurring between 0 and 179 days before revision surgery. Among them, we could sample intra-articular liquid directly in 60 cases and after saline solution injection in 43 cases, whereas 3 cases remained unsuccessful. According to intraoperative samples, 24 shoulders were infected but only 10 of 24 (42%) yielded pathogens in the aspirate. Moreover, of the 43 saline solution–enforced irrigations, none revealed bacteria but 8 (17%) confirmed infection in intraoperative samples. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of presurgical aspirations were 33%, 98%, 80%, and 83%, respectively. Conclusion: When surgical revision is planned, presurgical shoulder joint aspiration is not reliable to sufficiently exclude shoulder joint infection. Nevertheless, a positive aspiration finding can guide clinical decision making, so we propose to perform aspiration only if there is a clinically high index of suspicion for an infection. Irrigation after unsuccessful primary aspiration is futile.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The utility of single-injection and continuous peripheral nerve blocks is limited by short duration of analgesia and catheter-related complications, respectively. This double-blind, multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-injection, ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block (BPB) with liposomal bupivacaine (LB) added to a standardized pain management protocol for shoulder surgery. METHODS: Adults undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair were randomized to receive LB 133 mg, LB 266 mg (pharmacokinetic and safety analyses only), or placebo, added to a standardized analgesia protocol. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of visual analog scale pain intensity scores through 48 hours postsurgery. Secondary end points were total opioid consumption, percentage of opioid-free patients, and time to first opioid rescue through 48 hours. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected through 120 hours and on days 7 and 10. Adverse events were documented. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients received treatment (LB 133 mg, N = 69; LB 266 mg, N = 15; placebo, N = 71). BPB with LB 133 mg was associated with significantly improved AUC of pain scores (least squares mean [SE] = 136.4 [12.09] vs 254.1 [11.77], P < 0.0001), opioid consumption (least squares mean [SE] = 12.0 [2.27] vs 54.3 [10.05] mg, P < 0.0001), median time to opioid rescue (4.2 vs 0.6 h, P < 0.0001), and percentage of opioid-free patients (treatment difference = 0.166, 95% confidence interval = 0.032-0.200, P = 0.008) through 48 hours vs placebo. Adverse event incidence was comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Single-injection BPB with LB 133 mg provided analgesia through 48 hours postsurgery with reduced opioid use compared with placebo after shoulder surgery.

N2  - Introduction For patients who are diagnosed with lesions of the rotator cuff that present advanced levels of fatty degeneration, arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff remains controversial. This controversy can be attributed to the frequently reported high failure rate of the tendon fixation and the fact that it remains unclear why repair for these tears results in significant clinical improvement independent of the occurrence of such a re-tear. Recent publications have reported comparable clinical improvements when merely a tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon was performed and the rotator cuff tear was left untreated. These observations raise questions on the value of performing the more extensive cuff repairs in degenerative cuff tears. Even more, rehabilitation after an isolated tenotomy is much less cumbersome as compared with rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair and, therefore, might result in improved patient satisfaction. The goal of this trial is to study function and quality-of-life of patients undergoing arthroscopic biceps tenotomy with or without an additional cuff repair and to include an economic evaluation. Methods and analysis This multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, including an economic evaluation, is designed to compare the short-term and long-term outcome of patients who underwent an arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon with or without a cuff repair. We will include 172 patients with stage 2-3 Goutallier fatty infiltration cuff tears and with clinical symptoms of biceps pathology. Primary outcome is the rotator cuff specific quality-of-life (Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index) on the short term (6 months postoperatively). Secondary outcomes are quality-of-life 1, 2 and 5 year postoperatively and function (Constant-Murley score, glenohumeral range of motion), recovery status, pain (visual analogue scale), economic evaluation, satisfaction of treatment on the short-term and long-term and re-tear rate at 6 months determined with an ultrasound. Ethics and dissemination This trial has been approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committees United (MEC-U), Nieuwegein, the Netherlands (NL54313.100.15) and will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). The results of this study will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and at (inter)national conferences. Furthermore, we will share our findings with the appropriate guideline committees. Trial registration number The Dutch Trial Registry (NL4010).

N2  - Background: Rotator cuff pathology is the most common cause of shoulder pain in adults, accounting for nearly 70% of shoulder-related visits to clinicians. However, physical examination findings may be limited because of pain or patient inhibition. Purpose: To establish whether a relationship exists between pain, range of motion, and strength in patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A single-blind, randomized controlled study of 40 patients undergoing rotator cuff repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears was performed. Patients were randomized to receive either a subacromial 10-mL 2% lidocaine injection or a sham injection, with no contents being injected into the subacromial space. Before the injection, patients were assessed using a visual analog scale for pain (VAS-Pain) as well as the Constant-Murley subjective questionnaire and objective physical examination. The examination was repeated 10 minutes after injection and 6 months postoperatively. VAS-Pain after injection was not assessed. The assessment at 6 months was performed to demonstrate improvement of rotator cuff function after operative management. Statistical analysis included Student t and chi-square tests as well as multivariate binomial logistic regression analyses to identify predictors for improvement after injection. Results were considered significant if P <.05. Results: Range of motion, strength, and Constant-Murley score significantly improved after a subacromial lidocaine injection (P <.05). Range of motion, strength, Constant-Murley score, and VAS-Pain significantly improved at final follow-up compared with the preinjection assessment for both groups (P <.05); however, there was no difference (P >.05) between groups at 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: After subacromial lidocaine injections, patients exhibited modest but significant improvements in range of motion, strength, and the Constant-Murley score. Pain may limit range of motion and strength in patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears independent of the mechanical impact of the tear itself.

N2  - Purpose: Muscle, bone and tendon regeneration depend on the microperfusion of the corresponding tissue which can be quantified with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent (SonoVue®). This study investigated the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in musculoskeletal patients and gives an overview of musculoskeletal CEUS applications. Patients and Methods: Based on 13 studies in a standardized monocentric setting, a total of 2268 CEUS examinations in 764 patients were performed and AEs due to the administration of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent were classified as either mild, moderate or severe. Results: No fatal events occurred. AEs were reported in three cases, of which only one was classified as severe and two as mild. The total rate of all AEs was 0.13%and 0.04% for severe AEs. Conclusion: The present analysis confirms the safety of musculoskeletal CEUS using sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent with a lower rate of AEs than that reported for other contrast agents even in elderly patients with concomitant diseases.

N2  - Introduction: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is a useful procedure with broadening applications, but it has the best outcomes when used for rotator cuff tear arthropathy. However, this procedure is not without complications. While scapular notching and aseptic loosening are more common complications that have been extensively studied in the literature, dissociation of the glenoid component and incomplete glenosphere seating has not received much attention. Specifically, little research has explored appropriate management of incomplete seating of the glenosphere component, and no gold standard for treatment of this complication has emerged. Methods: In the case described here, an elderly patient with an incompletely seated glenosphere component post-operatively opted to pursue conservative management in order to avoid revision surgery if possible. Results: The partially engaged, superiorly directed components in this case exhibited spontaneous complete and symmetric seating of the glenosphere between six and twelve months post-operatively, indicating that conservative management of this complication in low-demand patients may be a viable option to avoid the risks associated with revision surgery. Conclusion: Further research should be pursued to explore what patient and prosthesis design factors may be suited to observation with serial radiographs when incomplete seating of the glenosphere component occurs.

N2  - Introduction: Acromioclavicular joint cyst (AJC) is a very uncommon condition of the shoulder observed in elderly patients, caused by a degenerative acromioclavicular (AC) joint, frequently associated to a rotator cuff tendon tear. There are two possible cause for the cyst formation. We report two different cases of a AC synovial cyst, with and without rotator cuff tear. Presentation of cases: We report two cases, in patients aged respectively 80 and 77 years, with a very large AJC. In one case, the cyst was associated to a rotator cuff tear, while in the other case, the rotator cuff did not present any evident lesion. Both cysts were successfully surgical excised and a distal clavicle resection was performed. Discussion: AJC is a rare complication observed in degenerative AC joint and in the majority of cases is associated to a rotator cuff tear. The diagnosis may be made by ultrasound and conventional radiographic examination, although MRI of the shoulder is generally preferred as it allows to better identify the condition of the rotator cuff. Generally, local aspiration of the cyst and corticosteroid injection fails with recurrence of the cyst and surgically treatment is indicated, especially in painful cases. Conclusion: Painful AJC should be surgically treated by excision of the cyst associated to a lateral clavicle resection; when a symptomatic massive rotator cuff is present, a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty may be considered. However, in elderly patients, who have no discomfort, watchful waiting may be the treatment of choice.

N2  - A team approach among orthopaedic surgeons, infectious disease specialists, and patients is of paramount importance when treating periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). Treatment usually includes various surgical approaches along with antibiotic treatment.Antibiotic selection requires a multifactorial decision that depends on the organism that is identified, its antibiotic-resistance profile, the extent of the infection, and factors associated with the host.Antibiotic duration is dependent on surgical intervention and the type of organism. Typically, patients are treated for 6 weeks after debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) and for 4 to 6 weeks after single-stage and 2-stage revision arthroplasty.Levofloxacin in combination with rifampin has shown favorable outcomes for Staphylococcus PJI treatment. Quinolones have excellent bioavailability and bone and joint concentrations. Ciprofloxacin can be used for sensitive gram-negative infections.Evidence is emerging that supports the use of oral antibiotics after 7 days of intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of PJI. Although this should be considered carefully, it can potentially alleviate the burden on patients and caregivers, with fewer intravenous lines and the potential for fewer complications.

N2  - Background and aim of the work: Post-operative periprosthetic shoulder fractures incidence is gradually raising due to aging of population and increasing of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Management of this complication represents a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon. Aim of the present study is to critically review the recent literature about epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, management and outcome of post-operative periprosthetic humeral fractures occurring on RTSA. Methods: A systematic search of Em-base, Medline and Pubmed was performed by two reviewers who selected the eligible papers favoring studies published in the last ten years. Epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic features, clinical management and outcome of different techniques were all reviewed. Results: 31 studies including reviews, meta-analysis, case reports, clinical and biomechanical studies were selected. Conclusions: Correct clinical management requires adequate diagnosis and evaluation of risk factors. Conservative treatment is rarely indicated. Locking plate fixation and revision arthroplasty are both valuable treatment methods. Surgical technique should be chosen considering age and functional demand, comorbidities, fracture morphology and location, bone quality and stability of the implant. Given the correct indication all surgical treatment can lead to satisfactory clinical and radiographic results despite a relevant complication rate. (www.actabiomedica.it).

N2  - Background: Glenoid loosening remains one of the most common concerns at mid- to long-term follow-up after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Pegged and keeled designs have been compared at short-term follow-up, but few studies have compared outcomes at mid-term follow-up. Our purpose was to compare minimum 5-year outcomes of pegged and keeled cemented, all-polyethylene glenoids in TSA. The hypothesis was that no difference in functional outcomes or loosening would be found between the 2 components. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective study of TSAs with either a pegged or keeled cemented glenoid. At a minimum of 5 years postoperatively, functional outcomes and radiographic loosening were compared. Results: Forty-seven TSAs were available for follow-up, including 20 pegged and 27 keeled components, at a mean of 79 months (range, 60-114 months) postoperatively. Overall, functional outcomes improved in both groups from preoperatively to postoperatively, and no difference was found between the 2 groups. Radiographic glenoid loosening (score ≥ 3) was observed in 9 of 27 keeled glenoids (33.3%) compared with 5 of 20 pegged glenoids (25%) (P = .54). Loosening was associated with lower postoperative forward flexion (P = .026), lower American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (P = .030), and higher visual analog scale pain scores (P = .007). Conclusion: Radiographic glenoid loosening of a cemented, all-polyethylene component was associated with decreased functional outcomes at minimum 5-year follow-up of TSAs. However, this study showed no difference in loosening rates between keeled and pegged components.

N2  - Continuous peripheral nerve blocks refer to a local anesthetic solution administered via perineurally placed catheters in an effort to extend the benefits of a single-shot peripheral nerve block. They offer several advantages in the postoperative period including excellent analgesia, reduced opioid consumption and associated side effects, enhanced rehabilitation and improved patient satisfaction. The current trend towards less invasive, one-day surgery and enhanced recovery programs may decrease the requirement of catheter use. Prolonged motor block in particular is associated with undesirable outcomes. Should we routinely use continuous peripheral nerve blocks in our daily practice? This PRO-CON debate aims at answering the question from the experts' perspectives. Fascial compartment and wound catheters are outside the scope of this debate.

N2  - Purpose: Rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in hemiarthroplasty and unconstrained total shoulder arthroplasty. The reverse shoulder arthroplasty can be utilized to address the shortcomings of hemiarthroplasty and unconstrained total shoulder arthroplasty in the inflammatory arthritis patient population. The objective of the present study was to retrospectively review clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients who underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies and provide a comprehensive analysis to identify factors that may alter patient outcomes. Methods: We identified 91 primary reverse shoulder arthroplasties performed between 2006 and 2013 in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Seventy-five had at least two years of follow up with an average follow-up of 4.0 years. The average age at the time of surgery was 70 years old. Peri-operative use of steroids, biologics, and methotrexate were reviewed. Outcomes evaluated included revision and reoperation rates, complications, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, simple shoulder test (SST) scores, component loosening, and scapular notching. Results: The two and five year implant revision-free survival was 99%. The two and five year re-operation-free survival was 97%. Eighteen (24%) glenoid components required augmentation with corticocancellous autograft from the humeral head. There were two cases of glenoid loosening with gross changes in position. Patients experienced significant pain relief with a 92% satisfaction rate. Shoulder elevation and external rotation improved from 65 and 21 degrees pre-operatively to 138 and 45 degrees post-operatively, respectively (p <.01). Average ASES and SST scores were 72 and 7.0, respectively. The use of prednisone, DMARDs, or biologic medications had no significant impact on outcomes.

N2  - Background: The ideal analgesic modality for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) remains controversial. We hypothesized that a multimodal analgesic pathway incorporating continuous interscalene blockade (ISB) provides better analgesic efficacy than both single-injection ISB and local infiltration analgesia. Methods: This single-center, parallel, unblinded, randomized clinical trial evaluated 129 adults undergoing primary TSA. Patients were allocated to single-injection ISB, continuous ISB, or local infiltration analgesia. The primary outcome was the Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (range, 0 [best] to 28 [worst]) on postoperative day 1. Additional outcomes included pain scores, opioid consumption, quality of life, and postoperative complications in the first 24 hours, at 3 months, and at 1 year. Results: We analyzed 125 patients (42 with single-injection ISB, 41 with continuous ISB, and 42 with local infiltration analgesia). The Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score was significantly improved in the continuous group (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile], 0 [0, 2]) compared with the single-injection group (2 [1, 4]; P = .002) and local infiltration analgesia group (3 [2, 4]; P < .001). Pain scores were significantly lower in the continuous group compared with the local infiltration analgesia group (P < .001 for all time points) and after 12 hours from ward arrival compared with the single-injection group (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile], 1.0 [0.0, 2.8] vs. 2.5 [0.0, 4.0]; P = .016). After postanesthesia recovery discharge, opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents) was significantly lower in the continuous group (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile], 7.5 mg [0.0, 25.0 mg]) than in the local infiltration analgesia group (30 mg [15.0, 52.5 mg]; P < .001) and single-injection group (17.6 mg [7.5, 45.5 mg]; P = .010). No differences were found across groups for complications, 3-month outcomes, and 1-year outcomes. Conclusion: Continuous ISB provides superior analgesia compared with single-injection ISB and local infiltration analgesia in the first 24 hours after TSA.

N2  - Background and aims Shoulder arthroplasty (SA) can cause severe postoperative pain. Continuous catheter-based interscalene block (CISB) prolongs analgesia compared to single injection (SISB). We reviewed postoperative analgesia and side effects following CISB or SISB for SA. Methods A retrospective review of 60 SA patients; random selection of equal numbers receiving general anaesthesia plus either CISB or SISB. Assessment of average postoperative pain and opioid requirements (converted to equivalent doses of intravenous morphine). Duration of hospital stay, postoperative oxygen administration and hypoxemia episodes (arterial oxygen saturation <92% in non COPD patients ; <88% in COPD patients) were collected from the electronic health records. Results We reviewed 60 patients who underwent SA from September 2017 until December 2018. Pain scores were similar with no patients complaining of severe pain in either group and the majority of patients scoring no pain or mild pain throughout. Opioid requirements were modest throughout. 57% of patients in CISB group required postoperative oxygen compared with only 10% in SISB group. 20% of patients in CISB group had hypoxaemia episodes compared with 10% in SISB group. Conclusions CISB and SISB produced satisfactory analgesia. Patients receiving CISB had a higher incidence of hypoxaemia and requirement for oxygen therapy. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background/Purpose : Up until a few years ago, my 30+ year journey with Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid was treated mostly with medication management alone. I was diagnosed at age 3 with Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. At time of diagnosis I was expected to be in a wheelchair by age 6. With the help of NSAIDs, prednisone and Gold Injections, this was not the case. Eventually, I began trials of various drug cocktails that included those previously listed with the addition of DMARDs and a rotation of various supplements including shark cartilage and vitamins. The ever changing trials of these cocktails continued until my mid-teenage years when biologic medication came to market. After being unsuccessful long term on any one medication, disease progression continued and I underwent bilateral shoulder replacement surgery in 2018. The integration of additional treatment options such as diet, exercise and mindfulness was the logical next step in my treatment journey. Treatment : Through desperation in search of a better quality of life due to the progression of my illness, I was introduced to Reiki and meditation. I have added meditation and Reiki into my care plan in addition to current medication treatments and surgical interventions. Meditation and Reiki have enabled me to become more empowered and less fearful of the future of illness. I have studied and become certified as a Reiki Practitioner as well as regularly meditate through various Apps, walking mediation and mindfulness practice. Maintenance : In order to fully feel the benefits of mediation and Reiki, I practice regularly as well as attend classes, certifications and educate myself about furthering my practice in this approach. By ensuring that mediation and Reiki are a regular part of my current lifestyle, I am able to be more present in the care of my illness and work better with my medical team. This also helps me stay more compliant with medications and medical appointments as my anxiety has decreased regarding these major parts of my life. Shannan with JRA Reiki Certification Quality of Life : Although physical disease progression continues, I have had a better sense of control of fear and anxiety related to my illness. By practicing Reiki, I feel empowered and more peaceful. Regular meditation has allowed me to reflect on my disease and anxiety related to it. Without incorporating these practices into my treatment plan, I believe that my illness complications may have worsened. These practices have allowed me peace and acceptance with what is and the ability to play a strong, more active role in my disease management on a daily basis.

N2  - Purpose of Review: To summarize the recent literature regarding regional anesthesia of the upper extremity. Recent Findings: Brachial plexus anatomy is more variable than previously believed. Several novel techniques for upper extremity blockade have been recently described. The ability of local anesthetic adjuvants and liposomal bupivacaine to prolong block duration has been investigated with mixed results. Regional anesthesia has played an important role in the expansion of ambulatory upper extremity surgery, especially shoulder arthroscopy and arthroplasty. Knowledge about the management of local anesthetic systemic toxicity remains essential for the safe performance of upper extremity blocks. Summary: The widespread adoption of ultrasound guidance for nerve blocks and the increasing emphasis on value in healthcare have fostered numerous innovations in regional anesthesia of the upper extremity in recent years. Further research is needed to determine the best technique for diaphragm-sparing shoulder analgesia and the most appropriate role for liposomal bupivacaine.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Identifying patient factors that affect length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition after shoulder arthroplasty is key in managing patient expectations. In this systematic review, we identify patient-specific covariates that correlate with increased LOS and need for discharge to a facility. METHODS: We searched biomedical databases to identify associations between patient-specific factors and LOS and discharge disposition after shoulder arthroplasty. We included all studies involving hemiarthroplasty, anatomic shoulder arthroplasty, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Reported patient and provider factors were evaluated for their association with increased LOS and discharge to a facility. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified. Age >65 years, female sex, obesity, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty were associated with extended LOS and correlated with discharge to a facility. Greater hospital and surgeon volume were associated with decreased LOS and decreased risk of discharge to a facility. Local injection of liposomal bupivacaine combined with intravenous dexamethasone was associated with reduced LOS. DISCUSSION: Patient factors affecting LOS and likelihood of discharge to a facility include age >65 years, female sex, diabetes, obesity, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. These factors can be used to develop studies to preoperatively predict outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty and to help identify patients who may be at risk of prolonged postoperative admission. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic level IV.

N2  - Background Locking plate technology has increased fixation (ORIF)of proximal humerus fractures dramatically. However, reported rates of success and complications have varied widely. A number of technical pearls have been recommended to lower the complication rate of this technique. These include valgus reduction of the fracture, metaphyseal shortening for enhanced fracture stability, augmentation of the fixation with sutures though the rotator cuff and plate, and the selective addition of fibular strut allograft augmentation. In addition, delayed postoperative rehabilitation have been associated with success in some case series. Finally, shorter proximal locking screws, to avoid iatrogenic or delayed screw penetration into the joint, have become more frequent. There have been few large, single center studies on the modern application of this technology. Methods Between 2005 and 2015, 173 consecutive proximal humerus fractures in patients over the age of 60 were treated at our institution with internal fixation using locked plating. Shoulders with less than 2 years of follow-up were excluded from the study unless they had undergone reoperation or radiographic failure. This left 131 shoulders available for final analysis (76% of eligible). The average age was 73 (60-95)years, and 84% were females. Fractures were classified according to Neer's criteria as 2-part fractures (61-47%), 3-part fractures (59-45%), and 4-part fractures (11-8%). Failure was defined as reoperation or radiographic evidence of hardware failure, severe arthritis, and intraarticular screw penetration. The average follow-up was 6.1 years. Results Failures, complications and reoperation rate There was an overall failure rate of 34%. This correlated with fracture type, with a failure rate of 26% in 2-part fractures (16 failures), 39% in 3-parts (23 failures), and 45% in 4-parts (11 failures)[Table 1]. Failure rate was also correlated with age, with a 26% failure rate for patients in their 60s, 40% failure rate for patients in their 70s, and 48% failure rate for patients in their 80s [Table 2]. None of the six patients in their 90s failed. There was no difference between the failure rate with and without fibular allograft (33% vs 34%). The main complications that led to failure were AVN with severe head collapse (±screw penetration)in 23 patients (52% of failures), intraarticular screw penetration in 6 patients (14% of failures), hardware failure in 5 patients (11%), severe posttraumatic arthritis in 4 patients (9%), severe cuff failure in 3 patients (7%), nonunion in 2 patients (5%)and severe malunion in 1 patient (2%). When all surgical complications were included, there was an overall complication rate of 44%. The majority of complications that didn't lead to revision or failure were mild, asymptomatic AVN (6 cases), and mild, asymptomatic arthritis (3 cases). There was also one case of tuberosity escape, one asymptomatic loose screw, one case of frozen shoulder requiring injection, and 1 case of asymptomatic rotator cuff failure. Most patients with radiographic or clinical failure did not undergo reoperation. The overall reoperation rate was 11% (14 patients). This correlated with fracture type, with 7% of 2-part fractures (4 shoulders), 14% of 3-parts (8 shoulders), and 18% of 4-parts (2 shoulders)requiring reoperation. Revision operations were reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA)in 8 patients, hardware removal in 5 patients, and revision ORIF in 1 patient. Clinical outcomes Overall patient reported outcomes were satisfactory in patients without failure. VAS for pain averaged 0 at rest and 1 with activity. The average SANE score of this cohort was 92. At final follow up, for patients with failure (including those who had required revision operation), the VAS (rest)was 1, VAS (activity)was 2, and average SANE score was 77. Discussion and Conclusions Internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures with locking plates in patients over the age of 60 resulted in a 44% complication rate, including a 34% failure rate defined as reoperation or radiographic failure. Higher complication and failure rates were observed in older patients and more complex fractures. However, the reoperation rate was relatively low (11%), which may be partly due to unwillingness to offer revision surgery to older patients with failed fixation if clinically well tolerated. Improvements in fracture fixation techniques, implants and instruments are required to improve the surgical management of proximal humerus fractures.

N2  - Introduction: Pneumococcal pyogenic arthritis after steroid injection for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is an extremely rare complication. Typically pneumococcal arthritis affects older patients with underlying medical comorbidities or risk factors. In this report, we describe a case of pneumococcal arthritis of the shoulder with cartilage destruction following two steroid injections in an otherwise healthy adult. Case Presentation: A 36-year-old man presented in our hospital with left shoulder pain and reduced shoulder motion since six weeks without prior trauma. Clinical examination revealed reduced range of motion for abduction and external rotation without clinical signs of infection. Rotator cuff strength was not impaired. A fluoroscopy-guided glenohumeral steroid injection was performed after clinically diagnosing adhesive cap-sulitis. At five weeks follow-up the patient reported pain relief, however range of motion did not improve significantly despite physiotherapy. A second steroid injection was scheduled in the radiology department. An irregular subchondral trabecular structure was evident under fluoros-copy, however this remained unnoticed at the time. Twelve days after the second injection an extensive pyogenic arthritis developed. Open debridement was performed at admission and aspirate and biopsies were taken. Streptococcus pneumoniae could be isolated. Malignancy was histologically excluded. Bacteremia or concomitant pneumococcal infection were not detected except for an unspecific gingivitis. Despite immediate surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy according to current guidelines and a second look, cartilage destruction could not be averted. Infection was treated successfully but the patient depended on oxyco-done/naloxone and remained unable to work. Eight months after pneu-mococcal arthritis a short stem anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty was performed. Conclusion: Pneumococcal pyogenic arthritis typically occurs via hem-atogenous seeding from an extraarticular source. Intraarticular steroid injections have a local immunosuppressive effect that can facilitate bacterial seeding if a known or unknown concomitant pneumococcal infection is present. High suspicion is crucial if fluoroscopy shows an irregular subchondral bone that may indicate subchondral bone infarction secondary to bacterial arthritis and further imaging and joint aspiration for culture may be necessary to establish a diagnosis.

N2  - Purpose. There are limited data on the effect of ceftriaxone on methotrexate clearance, with results of some studies indicating altered methotrexate pharmacokinetics with the administration of ceftriaxone. We describe 2 possible cases demonstrating an interaction between methotrexate and ceftriaxone, resulting in profound neutropenia. Summary. The decision to continue methotrexate therapy in the setting of surgery or during treatment of an active infection continues to be a topic of debate due to perceived negative effects on the healing process. Methotrexate is typically administered at a lower dose for inflammatory arthritis than for hematologic indications, thus having less immunosuppression potential. However, if methotrexate is continued during treatment of infection, drug interactions along with effects on the healing process should be considered. Ceftriaxone is commonly considered safe for long-term therapy due to its favorable adverse effect and drug interaction profile. Ceftriaxone is partially eliminated via organic anion transporters in the kidneys, leading to potential competition with methotrexate clearance in the renal tubules. Clinicians using these drugs concurrently should be aware of the potential for development of neutropenia and monitor patients receiving this combination closely. Conclusion. Two patients receiving ceftriaxone therapy in the setting of a joint infection developed profound neutropenia after resuming oral methotrexate therapy for inflammatory arthritis.

N2  - Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are a common cause of shoulder pain and weakness in the elderly (age > 65yrs) and result in reduced quality of life, loss of income and a burden on health care. With the elderly population living longer there is a growing interest in the effective and efficient management of RCTs. In a majority of cases, the initial treatment is conservative, with physical therapy, analgesics and possibly corticosteroid or plasma rich protein injections. There are various surgical options, including rotator cuff repair, superior capsule reconstruction, subacromial decompression and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative review of evidence guiding the management options for RCTs in the elderly.

N2  - Introduction: Daptomycin is a semi-synthetic cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against gram positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) for which it, alongside vancomycin, has been a listed first line agent per Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Clinicians are primarily familiar with myopathy as a potential adverse effect, as CPK levels are monitored during prolonged therapy. Nonetheless, we present a case of an uncommon pulmonary adverse effect of daptomycin therapy. Case: 81-year-old female with a history of a right total shoulder arthroplasty complicated by multiple prosthetic joint infections (positive for methicillin-resistant S.epidermidis and Proteus spp.) presented as a transfer to our hospital with a 2 day history of fever and pleuritic chest pain. She was on day 24 of intravenous daptomycin and ceftriaxone at the time of transfer. CT chest from the referring facility revealed mild pulmonary edema. On admission, she was afebrile with mild sinus tachycardia. Exam illustrated expression of brown fluid from the surgical wound as well as clear lung sounds on auscultation. Labs illustrated a leukocytosis with an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 960 (4%). Sepsis workup was initiated while daptomycin and ceftriaxone were continued. Soon after, she abruptly became hypoxic requiring up to 4 liters/min by nasal cannula. Repeat CT chest demonstrated new patchy ground-glass, subpleural opacities in bilateral upper lobes and right middle lobe consistent with Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP). Daptomycin was discontinued in favor of doxycycline, and a high dose prednisone taper was started for treatment of AEP. Sepsis workup remained negative and she clinically improved in the following days. Her chronic shoulder wound thereafter was managed conservatively. Discussion: This case highlights a severe adverse effect of Daptomycin requiring immediate workup and recognition. The hypothesized mechanism is that the sequestration of daptomycin into pulmonary surfactant causes an antigen mediated process via macrophages and T-helper 2 cells, resulting in the release of IL-5 with promotion of eosinophils. Literature review performed by Higashi et. al showed that the median time between the intiation of daptomycin to onset of AEP was 22.0-23.0 days for ≤6 mg/kg and 14.8 days for >6 mg/kg, signifying a possible dose-related association. It is therefore prudent for clinicians to identify risk factors and develop concordant screening measures for those on daptomycin to avoid AEP and its complications. (Figure Preseted).

N2  - Introduction: Despite improvements in technique and materials for rotator cuff repair, mean re-tear rates remain close to 30%. The aim of the present study was to assess injection of Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP™, Arthrex) for tendon healing after arthroscopic repair. The study hypothesis was that ACP™ improves the tendon-healing rate. Material and method: A non-randomized comparative prospective study included all patients aged over 18 years operated on in 2010 for arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tear with ≤ 2 fatty degeneration on the Goutallier classification, whatever the severity of retraction, on virgin non-osteoarthritic shoulder without contraindications for magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography. The surgical protocol was standardized. The first half of the patient sample received end-of-procedure ACP™ injection to the repaired tendon, tuberosity freshening surface and subacromial space, and the second (control) half received no supplementary treatment. The main endpoint was tendon healing on MR arthrography at 6 months according to Sugaya. Secondary endpoints comprised shoulder pain at rest on a numerical scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) and Constant functional score. Results: Two of the 58 patients refused MR arthrography and 7 were lost to follow-up. Forty-nine patients (26 ACP™, 23 controls) were analyzed: 20 male, 29 female; mean age, 61 ± 7.3 years. There were no significant intergroup differences in healing rate at 6 months (ACP™ 73.1% vs. 78.3% controls; p = 0.75), shoulder pain (2 ± 1.8 vs. 2.6 ± 1.7, respectively; p = 0.24), or Constant score (77 ± 13.5/100 vs. 72.4 ± 12.3, respectively; p = 0.18). Conclusion: Associating ACP™ did not improve healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Sample size, however, had been calculated for a large expected difference, leading to lack of power. Level of evidence: III; case-control study.

N2  - Introduction: Peripheral nerve pain is known to be difficult to treat and often times refractory to medical and interventional therapy. Intrathecal routes of medication therapy and dorsal column stimulation (SCS) have been used in the past but tend to be very expensive and invasive and have not been shown to be consistently effective. Peripheral nerve stimulation is being explored as an alternative mechanism to treat peripheral nerve pain. In this case series we explore peripheral nerve stimulators (SPRINT, SPR Therapeutics). The treatment period is 60 days, after which the percutaneous lead is removed, with aim of providing long term pain relief without having a device implanted long term. Methods: We recruited patients with chronic peripheral nerve pain that has been refractory to previous therapies (including but not limited to opi-oid medication, antineuroleptics, nerve blocks, peripheral joint injections, physical therapy). These patients were suffering from shoulder, knee, or hip pain and had diagnoses ranging from prior shoulder replacement, hemiplegia, RUE plexopathy, bilateral transhumeral amputation, tetraplegia, phantom limb pain, prior THA, and prior TKA. A SPRINT PNS device was placed and monitored for 6-10 weeks. Pain scores were compared prior to implantation, at a 4 week follow up with the device in place, and at a follow up visit after the device was removed. Results: Twelve patients have undergone placement of the SPRINT PNS device. Three patients had bilateral implants, so 15 total devices have been placed thus far. At this time, several patients are within their 60 day implant window so we do not have full outcome data on these patients. Moreover, we do anticipate 6 to 12 more patients by the time this data would be presented and therefore the case series would be larger. Of those who have completed the 60 day treatment window, nearly all of them experienced pain relief while their PNS device was in place, with several patients reporting total relief and many continued to experience relief of their pain at their follow up visit after the device had been removed. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve stimulators appear to be an effective treatment for chronic peripheral nerve pain and may even provide relief for an extended period of time after the device has been removed.

N2  - Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an analgesic and chondroprotective agent often used for the nonoperative treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). The effects of HA injections are well studied in the treatment of knee OA, but the effects in glenohumeral OA remain unclear. This study evaluated the efficacy of HA to reduce pain in patients with glenohumeral OA. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase were searched from the database inception date through January 16, 2018. Two reviewers independently screened articles for eligibility and extracted data for analysis. A methodological quality assessment was completed for all included studies, including assessment of risk of bias. The primary outcome was change in visual analog scale for pain. The secondary outcomes were functional outcome and adverse events. Results: In the HA arm, the reduction of visual analog scale pain score at 3 months was 26.2 mm (95% confidence interval, 22.0-30.3 mm; I2 = 31%) and at 6 months was 29.5 mm (95% confidence interval, 25.5-33.4 mm; I2 = 19%). All studies reported an improvement in functional outcome. Similar clinical improvements were reported in the intervention and control groups, suggesting that these improvements may not be directly related to HA. Commonly reported adverse events were rare and included swelling and mild pain at the injection site, local effusion, lethargy, and face rash. Conclusion: Intra-articular HA injection is safe and improves pain for patients with glenohumeral OA. Pain improvements also reported in the control group suggest that a significant placebo effect may be present with respect to intra-articular shoulder injection. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of HA and identify optimal dosing and route of administration.

N2  - Introduction: In this study we sought to characterize etiologies and features of sciatic neuropathy unrelated to penetrating nerve trauma. Methods: This investigation was a retrospective review of 109 patients with electrodiagnostically confirmed sciatic neuropathies. Results: Hip replacement surgery represented the most common (34.9%) etiology, whereas inflammatory sciatic neuropathy was seen in 7.3%. Electrodiagnostic testing revealed an axonal neuropathy in 95.4% and a demyelinating neuropathy in 4.6%. Predominant involvement of the peroneal division was seen in 39.4% and was tibial in 5.5%. Nine of 31 (29.0%) patients who had MRI or neuromuscular ultrasound study showed abnormalities within the sciatic nerve. At the final visit, 46.4% of patients required assistance for ambulation. Young age, lack of severe initial weakness, and presence of tibial compound muscle action potential or sural sensory nerve action potential were predictors of favorable outcome. Discussion: Sciatic neuropathies are usually axonal on electrodiagnostic testing, affect preferentially the peroneal division, and are commonly associated with incomplete recovery.

N2  - BackgroundThe pain experience for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) patients in the first 2 weeks after surgery has not been well described. Many approaches to pain management have been used, with none emerging as clearly superior; it is important that any approach minimizes postoperative opioid use.Questions/purposes(1) With a long-acting nerve block and comprehensive multimodal analgesia, what are the pain levels after TSA from day of surgery until postoperative day (POD) 14? (2) How many opioids do TSA patients take from the day of surgery until POD 14? (3) What are the PainOUT responses at POD 1 and POD 14, focusing on side effects from opioids usage?MethodsFrom January 27, 2017 to December 6, 2017, 154 TSA patients were identified as potentially eligible for this prospective, institutional review board-approved observational study. Of those, 46 patients (30%) were excluded (either because they were deemed not appropriate for the study, research staff were not available, patients were not eligible, or they declined to participate), and another six (4%) had incomplete followup data and could not be studied, leaving 102 patients (66%) for analysis here. Median preoperative pain with movement was 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 5-9) and 13 of 102 patients used preoperative opioids. All patients received a single-injection bupivacaine interscalene block with adjuvant clonidine, dexamethasone, and buprenorphine. Multimodal analgesia included acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids. The primary outcome was the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score with movement on POD 14. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest and with movement (day of surgery, and PODs 1, 3, 7 and 14), daily analgesic use from day of surgery to POD 14 (both oral and intravenous), Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (which assesses 12 symptoms ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 being the most distressing; the composite score is the mean of the 12 symptom-specific scores) on POD 1, and the PainOut questionnaire on POD 1 and POD 14. The PainOut questionnaire includes questions rating nausea, drowsiness, itching from 0 (none) to 10 (severe), as well as rating difficulty staying asleep from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).ResultsThe median NRS pain scores with movement were 2 (IQR, 0-5) on POD 1, 5 (IQR, 3-6) on POD 3, and the pain score was 3 (IQR, 1-5) on POD 14. Median total opioid use (converted to oral morphine equivalents) was 16 mg (4-50 mg) for the first 24 hours, 30 mg (8-63 mg) for the third, and 0 mg (0-20 mg) by the eighth 24-hour period, while the most frequent number of activations of the intravenous patient-controlled analgesia device was 0. Median PainOut scores on POD 1 and POD 14 for sleep interference, nausea, drowsiness and itching were 0, and the median composite Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale score on day 1 was 0.3 (IQR, 0.1-0.5).ConclusionsClinicians using this protocol, which combines a long-acting, single-injection nerve block with multimodal analgesia, can inform TSA patients that their postoperative pain will likely be less than their preoperative pain, and that on average they will stop using opioids after 7 days. Future research could investigate what the individual components of this protocol contribute. Larger cohort studies or registries would document the incidence of rare complications. Randomized controlled trials could directly compare analgesic effectiveness and cost-benefits for this protocol versus alternative strategies, such as perineural catheters or liposomal bupivacaine. Perhaps most importantly, future studies could seek ways to further reduce peak pain and opioid usage on POD 2 and POD 3.Level of EvidenceLevel IV, therapeutic study.

N2  - Background: Osteonecrosis of the hips and knees is an often debilitating adverse event in children treated with glucocorticoids for leukemia and lymphoma but the impact of shoulder involvement has been understudied. Thus, we investigated the severity and functional impairment of shoulder osteonecrosis in a well-characterized population of pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed orthopaedic clinic and physical therapy evaluations to determine range of motion (ROM), pain, and impact of magnetic resonance-defined osteonecrosis (ON) on activities of daily living. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Results: We identified 35 patients (22 female), median age at cancer diagnosis 14.2 (range, 4.3 to 19) years; median age at ON diagnosis 16.7 (range, 5.5 to 28) years. Median time to last follow-up from diagnosis of primary malignancy was 6.4 (range, 0 to 12.7) years and from diagnosis of ON was 4.0 (range, 0 to 8.9) years. Twenty-two patients had magnetic resonance evidence of ON; 43 shoulders involved at least 30% of the articular surface of the capital humeral epiphyses. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events mean scores for initial assessments of 55 shoulders (29 patients) showed moderate negative impact of ON on activity of daily living (1.94), decreased ROM limiting athletic activity (0.98), and mild to moderate levels of pain (1.38). Analysis of this group's most recent assessment showed improvement in pain and ON over time, with an average pain grade of 0.58 indicating no pain to mild pain, and 1.37 for ON grade, indicating asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic impact on activities of daily living. We also found minimal worsening average ROM grades (1.11). Conclusions: Shoulder ON is an underappreciated adverse late effect of therapy in children treated for leukemia/lymphoma which can limit quality of life and functionality. In most cases, pain and disability can be improved with treatment. Level of Evidence: Level IV - case series.

N2  - Background and Aims There is a paucity of data on the safety of joint replacement surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], including those on tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors [anti-TNF]. We explored the risk of serious infections in this population. Methods A retrospective case-control study [2006-2014] was performed using the MarketScan Database. All patients aged 18-64 years with an International Classification of Diseases code for IBD and an IBD-specific medication, with ≥ 6 months of enrollment prior to hip, knee or shoulder replacement surgery, were included. Ten non-IBD controls were frequency-matched to each case on length of enrollment, year and the joint replaced. Primary outcome was serious infection [composite of joint infection, surgical site infection, pneumonia, sepsis] within 90 days of the operation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of IBD and IBD medications with serious infection. Results More patients with IBD [N = 1455] had serious infections than controls [3.2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.04], but not after controlling for comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.76). Among IBD patients, corticosteroids were associated with increased risk of serious infection [HR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.2-9.8; p < 0.01] while anti-TNFs were not. Opioids were also associated with increased risk of infection [HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; p < 0.01]. Conclusions After controlling for comorbidities, IBD patients were not at increased risk of serious infection following joint replacement. Corticosteroids, but not anti-TNFs or immunomodulators, were associated with increased risk of serious infections in IBD patients.

N2  - For posterosuperior tears, even though these are not absolute contraindications, the following preoperative variables have been found to significantly correlate with poorer outcomes when performing a latissimus dorsi tendon transfer (or possibly even other tendon transfers, but very few data are available concerning these tears): previous shoulder surgical procedure, atrophy and fatty infiltration (Goutallier stage of ≥3) of the teres minor muscle, subscapularis insufficiency (positive lift-off test), pseudoparetic shoulders (defined as those with massive rotator cuff tears and with active elevation of <90°), and passive forward elevation of ≤80°.For isolated subscapularis failure, pectoralis major tendon transfers have disappointing results, and some data on combined latissimus dorsi and teres major transfers have shown clinical improvement at 2 years.The following 5 principles of tendon transfers should be respected whenever possible: (1) accurate positioning of the transferred tendon reimplantation site, (2) physiological tensioning of the transferred muscle-tendon unit, (3) strong osseous fixation of the reimplanted tendon, (4) minimally invasive surgery to reduce muscle scarring (so as not to hinder excursion of the transfer), and (5) a synergistic transfer.

N2  - Background: This retrospective review evaluated 25 patients with 29 shoulders treated with arthroplasty for humeral head avascular necrosis (HHAVN) between 2004 and 2015. We hypothesized that regardless of implant, radiographic stage, or etiology, patients would appreciate significant improvement in pain, range of motion, and shoulder functionality after surgical intervention. Methods: Data were obtained by record review on all patients meeting inclusion criteria. Outcomes were evaluated using Simple Shoulder Test, Modified Constant Score, University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form. The data were assessed by all patients and subcategories (treatment, avascular necrosis stage, and underlying cause). Results: At a mean follow-up of 3.9 years (range, 1-8.5 years), all patients who underwent operative intervention for HHAVN showed statistically significant improvement in functionality measurements (P <.01). Patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) noted higher median outcome scores and greater improvement in all scoring methods compared with their hemiarthroplasty counterparts. The high-stage disease shoulders showed similar trends over low-stage counterparts. The shoulders in the trauma causal group had the highest scores in 3 of 4 outcome measures and favorable change in all scoring methods. These differences were not statistically significant (P >.05). No revision arthroplasties were required. Minor complications (suture abscess and intraoperative calcar fracture requiring cabling) occurred in 2 TSA patients. Conclusions: Our outcomes demonstrate that in the short- to midterm follow-up, TSA or hemiarthroplasty is a safe and equally effective treatment for patients diagnosed with HHAVN regardless of etiology and radiographic staging.

N2  - Background: The management of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) with debridement and retention of the implant (DAIR) has its rules. Some authors claim that lacking the exchange of mobile prosthetic parts is doomed to failure, while others regard it as optional. Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort in PJIs treated with DAIR. Results: We included 112 PJIs (69 total hip arthroplasties, 9 medullary hip prostheses, 41 total knee arthroplasties, and 1 total shoulder arthroplasty) in 112 patients (median age 75 years, 52 females (46%), 31 (28%) immune-suppressed) and performed a DAIR procedure in all cases—48 (43%) with exchange of mobile parts and 64 without. After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 94 patients (84%) remained in remission. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, remission was unrelated to PJI localization, pathogens, number of surgical lavages, duration of total antibiotic treatment or intravenous therapy, choice of antibiotic agents, immune-suppression, or age. In contrast, the exchange of mobile parts was protective (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2–2.9). Conclusions: In our retrospective single-center cohort, changing mobile parts of PJI during the DAIR approach almost doubled the probability for long-term remission.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to assess the incidence of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total Knee arthroplasty (TKA), total Hip arthroplasty (THA) and total Shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), to identify risk factors, determine the microbial spectrum and management’s outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control, retrospective observational study was performed analyzing patients who developed a PJI after TKA, THA, and TSA from 2000 to 2017 at our hospital. The patient’s risk profile was defined extracting from clinical records the following data: sex, age, BMI, type of implant, comorbidity, year of surgery, year of infection, previous intra-articular injection, microbial isolation, medical and surgical management outcome. We include in the “control group” for each “case” at least 3 patients who didn’t have a PJI after TJA. RESULTS: 28 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comparing the “cases” with “controls” demographics parameters, medical comorbidities and previous intra-articular injection were not associated with an increased risk of PJI. Comparing the “early/delayed group” with “late group”, BMI was associated with an increased risk of early/delayed PJI, while demographics parameters, medical comorbidities, and previous intra-articular injection did not significantly increase the risk of PJI. Logistic regression showed that for each BMI unit there was a 20-fold increased risk of early prosthetic infection (OR 1.19, IC 1.03-1.38, p=0.01). Staphylococci were isolated most frequently from pre-operative and intra-operative cultures. Two-stage arthroplasty exchange and surgical debridement resulted in the most performed surgical treatment with a success rate of 88 and 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a risk factor for “early/delayed infection” of TJA. Two-stage arthroplasty exchange, debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention in patients are treatments with a high rate of success in terms of reinfection.

N2  - Purpose Shoulder pain is the 3rd most common injury in able-bodied individuals and a frequent complaint for individuals who are wheelchair bound. Shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users can lead to an inability to perform daily activities and further debilitation. Current treatment largely involves regular physical therapy and repetitive corticosteroid injections. Surgical intervention is often the only option once those treatments have been exhausted. However, surgical repair is often not a practical option for manual wheelchair users due to the length of post op recovery; which requires patients to be completely dependent on a caretaker and can lead to further deconditioning. Methods A 60-year-old male, manual wheelchair user complains of severe bilateral shoulder pain secondary to a spinal cord injury 20 years prior. The patient reports shoulder pain for 2 decades, with the past 5 years being severe. Physical Therapy and corticosteroid injections which were once useful to the patient now have less efficacy and decreasing benefit in the patientâs pain and range of motion. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) shows severe degenerative joint disease in both the left and right shoulder joint. Due to the failure of traditional nonoperative care, surgical consultation was obtained and bilateral total shoulder replacement was recommended. Unfortunately, the patient would not be able to tolerate the post-operative recovery required. At this point, autologous micro fragmented adipose tissue was recommended as an alternative. This procedure was performed by obtaining 100ccs of lipoaspirate from the abdominal region using the traditional tumescent technique. Then, this was processed using the Lipogems system and a total of 24ccs of micro fragmented adipose was obtained. Using strict ultrasound guidance with a posterior approach, a total of 12ccs of micro fragmented adipose was injected into each Glenohumeral Joint. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. Results The patient had no improvement at 2 weeks post procedure; however, at 6 weeks post procedure, thepatientâs pain had completely resolved without improvement in his range of motion. His pain, as assessed by the Visual Analog Score (VAS), improved from 8/10 to 0/10. The patient then started a physical therapy regimen a- during which abduction of the joint improved from 50 degrees to 100 degrees and flexion improved from 40 to 60 degrees. Subjectively, the patient reported improved shoulder stability. Conclusions This case demonstrates that autologous micro fragmented adipose tissue has the potential to effectively treat chronic and debilitating shoulder pain without the drawbacks of surgical repair. The current approach to chronic shoulder pain that has failed traditional non-operative treatment is to move forward with surgical interventions. The use of micro fragmented adipose is a novel alternative that benefits those who are not ideal surgical candidates. Further research is needed to explore which intervention would allow for a better outcome with minimal complication and an easier post-operative course.

N2  - Background and Aims: To compare the benefits of indwelling interscalene catheters over single interscalene injections for shoulder replacements at a tertiary referral orthopaedic hospital Methods:We collected data from 13 patients having catheters, 26 patients having single-shot injections, and 2 patients who had no block. We assessed • Patient BMI, • Type of LA used, dose, and concentration, • Postoperative pain score with block working in recovery, pain when block wore off, post op analgesia used, and • Complications including, hoarse voice, dysphagia, dyspnoea and nausea, • how long the block lasted and how long the catheter was kept in place Results: Patients having single injection interscalene blocks for shoulder replacements had low pain scoreswith the block working. However they suffered high pain scoreswhen the block wore off after around 18 hours. Even with strong analgesia, post block wearing off, the pain was still very severe, and pre emptive analgesia before the block wore off did not seem to help. The catheter group had good pain relief, with blocks lasting around 40 hours, post catheter removal the pain was much lower than the single injection group. Therewere fewcomplications in either groups. The two patients who received no block at all had higher pain scores immediately post-operatively but lower pain scores on the ward the next day. Conclusions: We need to improve our analgesia for patients having single injection blocks when the block wears off, possibly having opiate PCAs ready for the wards. Catheters seem to work well and cause less problems with postoperative analgesia when they are removed.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the recent incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and delayed wound healing (DWH) and their risk factors after orthopedic surgeries for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Method: We investigated incidence of SSI and DWH from medical records of 508 orthopedic procedures for RA between 2013 and 2017 in our institution. In 180 procedures (35.3%), patients were treated with bDMARDs at the time of surgery. Risk factors for SSI and DWH were assessed by logistic regression analysis between age, disease duration, body mass index, pre-operative DAS28-CRP, surgical procedure (hand and wrist, foot and ankle, total knee arthro-plasty (TKA), total elbow arthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, spine surgery, arthroscopic synovectomy, and others), glucocorticoid use, methotrexate use, biologic disease-modi-fying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) use, and diabetes mellitus. Result: In all cases, SSI and DWH occurred in 10 cases (2.0%) and 15 cases (3.0%) respectively. 4 cases (2.2%) of SSI and 7 cases (4.0%) of DWH were recorded among 180 procedures for bDMARDs users. There was no significant difference in the incidence of SSI and DWH between bDMARDs users and bDMARDs non-users (Chi-squared test). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the foot and ankle surgeries were associated with an increased risk of SSI (OR:6.36, 95%CI:1.62-24.9; P = 0.008) and DWH (OR:5.54, 95%CI:1.86-16.5; P = 0.002). Conclusion: In the current series of patients, foot and ankle sur-gery was identified as the risk factor of SSI and DWH. The bDMARDs use was not associated with an increased risk of SSI or DWH.

N2  - Background/Diagnosis: I was diagnosed in 1987 at age 3 with Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis which effected every joint in my body. At time of diagnosis I was expected tobe in a wheelchair by age 6. With the help of NSAIDs, prednisone and Gold Injections, this was not the case. Eventually, I began trials of various drug cocktails that included those previously listed with the addition of DMARDs, namely Methotrexate and Plaquenil, and a rotation of various supplements including shark cartilage and vitamins. The ever changing trials of these cocktails continued until my midteenage years when biologic medication was introduced. After trying many different biologic medications and having varying results, I was taken off those medications and maintained on prednisone and Methotrexate for the time being. However, disease progression continues resulting in bilateral shoulder replacements in 2018. Treatment: I have adapted an integrative approach to my treatment plan along with my medical team. This approach includes incorporating vitamin supplements and dietary restrictions under the supervision and recommendation of my rheumatologist and regular walking. Maintenance: Prior to adding an integrative approach to my treatment, I was trying and most often failing drugs and drug cocktails regularly, which become stressful and disappointing. By adding specific supplements picked out by my doctor, I have guidance as to what is working for my body. In addition, dietary restrictions have improved my health and given me a sense of control over my illness. I use this sense of control to ensure that not only do I take my supplements and eat well; I move my body in one of the few ways it can regularly by walking daily. By ensuring that these integrative approaches are a regular part of my lifestyle, I am able to work better with my medical team as I am able to have some control of these treatments which will hopefully lead to decreased disease progression. Quality of Life: Due to recent changes in my disease progression, the addition of these integrative approaches has ultimately led me to having a better quality of life. I am able to see these additions of supplements and dietary changes as a privilege instead of an additional burden of this disease because I do have some sort of control here. Walking has given me a boost of self-confidence as I “compete” with friends and family thru an app that tracks my walking. This added bonus is not only fun but keeps me accountable in a positive way. Prior to these changes, I was disappointed in my health and disease progression. Now, I am more confident in having a fun, healthy way of taking control over my health. (Figure Presented) .

N2  - Purpose: A formalised, universally accepted, radiological staging system of gleno-humeral joint osteonecrosis (ON) is lacking. Consequently, there is absence of a standardised management strategy. The aim is to propose a simple radiological staging system of gleno-humeral joint ON based on principles of the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) Society and review of clinical practice. Methods: A radiographic and clinical review of 45 patients with haematological-induced gleno-humeral ON was performed. The related management plans were analysed and categorised. Results: Analysis divided the disease into stages 0–4. Non-interventional management was the first-line treatment in stages 1–2. If unsuccessful, arthroscopic core decompression was performed. Patients with stages 3–4 were initially managed conservatively. If unsuccessful, in younger patients, arthroscopic joint debridement and capsular release was trialled. In older patients, or where this approach failed, shoulder arthroplasty was advised. Conclusion: The simple radiological classification assessed is useful to the provision of a standardised staged management strategy of gleno-humeral ON.

N2  - Background: We report our experience with a bridging multimodal pain management program that provides comprehensive 48-hour pain control in patients undergoing total shoulder replacement (TSR). Methods: The study included all patients undergoing unilateral TSR by 1 surgeon between May 2015 and April 2017. There were 62 patients (23 men, 39 women) with an average age of 68 years (range 38-92 years). Of these, 31 underwent standard nonconstrained TSR and 31 underwent reverse TSR. The bridging multimodal pain management protocol included scalene block regional anesthesia using 0.25% bupivacaine enhanced with 4 mg of dexamethasone, application of 20 mg of liposomal bupivacaine diluted with 40 mL of normal saline in the periarticular soft tissues at time of closure, scheduled 24 hours of intravenous acetaminophen and ketorolac, and immediate cryotherapy. Parameters measured included hospital length of stay, postoperative use of intravenous narcotics, and 30-day hospital readmission. Results: The median length of stay was 1 day (range, 1-6; average, 1.5 days). Overall, 41 patients (66%) were discharged on postoperative day 1. Intravenous narcotics were required postoperatively in 22 patients (35.5%). There were no 30-day readmissions. Conclusion: This bridging multimodal pain management protocol resulted in a length of stay of 1 day for 66% of patients, even for higher-risk patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification III (63%). Of the 62 patients, 64% (n = 40) did not require postoperative intravenous narcotics. For properly selected patients, this program may be considered for performing TSR as an ambulatory procedure.

N2  - Case: A 70-year-old woman presented with severe but minimally painful right glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA), with progressive weakness and numbness radiating to the right hand. Imaging revealed a large fluid collection extending from the joint to the subcoracoid space, with a mass effect on the brachial plexus. A total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and decompression of a ganglion cyst were performed. Follow-up with serial electromyography demonstrated resolution of the brachial plexopathy and restoration of function. Conclusion: Ganglion cysts may arise secondary to severe glenohumeral OA and may compress the surrounding structures, producing a progressive plexopathy. Treatment of the underlying pathology with a TSA may be effective.

N2  - Background: Orthopedic surgeons are among the highest prescribers of narcotic pills, and no guidelines currently exist for appropriate management of postoperative pain within this field. The purpose of this study was to gain understanding of the current pain management strategies used perioperatively and postoperatively among orthopedic shoulder surgeons. Methods: Members of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons were e-mailed an online survey regarding methods for managing pain in the perioperative and postoperative setting for total shoulder arthroplasty, labral and capsular stabilization procedures, and rotator cuff repair. Postoperative narcotic prescribing amounts were converted into oral morphine equivalents. Results: The survey response rate was 25.8% (170/658), with >90% of surgeons reporting use of a standard pain management regimen in the perioperative and postoperative periods. A regional nerve block was used on the operative day by >80% of surgeons for all 3 procedures. Short-acting narcotics are prescribed for postoperative pain control by >85% of surgeons, with long-acting narcotics provided by <14%. More than 400 oral morphine equivalents of short-acting narcotic are prescribed by shoulder surgeons. Referral to a pain specialist or primary care physician is made after 12 weeks by 92.3% of surgeons if patients continue to require narcotic painkillers. Conclusion: The majority of shoulder surgeons use a standard pain management protocol in perioperative and postoperative settings. Regimens frequently include a regional nerve block, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and short-acting oral narcotics. Findings from this study provide guidelines on standard pain management strategies for common shoulder operations based on expert opinion.

N2  - Background and Aims: There is concern that anti-TNF agents impair wound healing and predispose patients to infections after surgery. However, interrupting therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may increase the risk of a disease flare. Joint replacement is a common elective surgery for which there is a paucity of data on the impact of antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents on surgical outcomes. We sought to examine the effect of IBD therapies on infectious complications in patients undergoing joint replacement surgery. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. We identified all patients aged 18-64 years with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) plus a prescription for an IBD medication who underwent elective hip, knee or shoulder replacement from 2006-2014. Only patients with at least six months of enrollment prior to surgery were included. The primary outcome was serious infection (composite of joint infection, surgical site infection requiring intervention, pneumonia, sepsis or Clostridium difficile infection [CDI]) within 90 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included IBD-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, IBD-related surgeries, corticosteroid prescriptions and new IBD therapy. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association of immunomodulators, anti-TNF and corticosteroids on the risk of serious infection, adjusting for comorbidities (Elixhauser). Results: We identified 1,455 patients with IBD who underwent joint replacement surgery; 631 patients were coded for CD (43%), 727 UC (50%), and 97 coded for indeterminate colitis (7%). Serious infections were coded in 4.4% within 90 days after surgery. A higher proportion of CD patients had a serious infection than those with UC (5.4% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.04) (Table 1). Compared to aminosalicylates, corticosteroid use was associated with increased risk of serious infection (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 - 4.1; p = 0.006) while anti-TNF mono or combination therapy was not associated with an increased risk of serious infection (HR 1.2; CI, 0.5 - 2.8; p = 0.67) (Table 2). The number of patients who experienced IBD complications was more than double in patients with CD as compared to UC, though the number was low in both groups (Table 1). Conclusion: Corticosteroids, but not anti-TNF or immunomodulators, were associated with increased risk of serious infections after joint replacement surgery. The association of corticosteroids with increased risk of serious infection re-emphasizes the importance of escalating patients to corticosteroid-sparing therapy. [Table Presented]

N2  - Background and Aims: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are increasingly diagnosed in older persons. While prior studies have explored the safety of abdominal surgery, there is a paucity of data on the safety of joint replacement surgery in IBD patients. Our aim was to explore the risk of serious infections in IBD patients undergoing joint replacement surgery. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. We identified all patients aged 18-64 years with an ICD-9-CM code for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) plus a prescription for an IBD medication who underwent elective hip, knee, or shoulder replacement from 2006 to 2014. Patients were required to have at least 6 months of enrollment prior to surgery to identify baseline comorbidities. For each patient, ten controls were frequency-matched on length of enrollment. The primary outcome was serious infection (composite of joint infection, surgical site infection requiring intervention, pneumonia, sepsis or Clostridium difficile infection [CDI]) within 90 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included urinary tract infection (UTI), mechanical complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and joint reoperation (through end of follow-up). Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association of IBD with serious infection, adjusted for comorbidities (Elixhauser), opioid use, age and smoking status. Results: We identified 1,455 patients with IBD and 14,550 controls who underwent joint replacement surgery. CD was coded in 631 patients (43%), 727 UC (50%), and 97 coded for indeterminate colitis (7%). More patients with IBD had a serious infection than controls (4.3% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.001), largely due to pneumonia and CDI (Table 1). There was no difference in the incidence of joint infection between cases and controls. Significantly more patients with IBD had a UTI and 90-day readmission than control patients. After controlling for baseline comorbidities, IBD was associated with higher risk of serious infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.18) (Table 2). Opioid use was also associated with an increased risk of serious infection (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.81). There were no differences in the proportions of mechanical complications, VTE, or joint reoperation. Among the sub-group of IBD patients who had not had an IBD-related surgery, hospitalization or corticosteroid prescription in the preceding 6 months, there was no significant difference in the incidence of serious infections compared to controls (p = 0.09). Conclusion: Patients with IBD had a higher incidence of serious infection following joint replacement surgery; however, this was not the case for IBD patients whose disease was well controlled for at least six months prior to surgery.

N2  - In the shoulder, rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a severe joint involvement that combines bony destruction and rotator cuff lesions. These reasons ultimately explain the failures of shoulder hemiarthroplasties or total shoulder anatomical arthroplasties, the results of which degrade over time. The reversed total shoulder arthroplasty can be effective in these situations, with good results over time in term of both pain and joint function. The surgical intervention remains difficult, considering the severity of the joint destruction and general status of patients, weakened by polyarticular involvement and long-term treatments. While initially high, the rate of perioperative and postoperative complications is currently better controlled, becoming comparable to the rate encountered in reverse arthroplasties for rotator cuff arthropathies. The infection and the periprosthetic fracture, in part due to corticosteroids treatments, are the most represented complications. The indication of reversed total shoulder arthroplasty must be the result of close consultation between the rheumatologist and the orthopaedic surgeon.

N2  - Introduction: Determining the significance of a positive culture result in revision shoulder arthroplasty can be challenging, due to the indolent nature of the commonly cultured organisms, most notably P. acnes. Recent studies have also shown a significant positive culture rate with P. acnes following primary shoulder arthroplasty in patients with no prior history of shoulder surgery. These findings suggest that some P. acnes culture growth following shoulder arthroplasty may represent culture contaminant or non-infectious colonization, rather than true infection. However, further data is needed to clarify such distinctions. We have previously demonstrated the benefit of synovial fluid cytokine analysis in the diagnosis of shoulder periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The purpose of this study was to compare synovial fluid cytokine profiles and culture results in patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) to non-arthritic patients undergoing primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR), in order to determine if cytokine levels can distinguish the significance of a positive culture result. Methods: A prospective study of 100 patients was performed; 50 patients with glenohumeral OA undergoing primary TSA and 50 non-arthritic patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Patients with a history of prior surgery on the operative shoulder or a chronic inflammatory disease were excluded. In addition to the stan-dard surgical procedure, all patients had 5 intraoperative culture specimens obtained; a synovial fluid sample and four tissue samples of the capsulosynovim; with all specimens sent for 14 day anaerobic culture hold for detection of P. acnes. In all cases, part of the synovial fluid sample was sent separately for measurement of 11 different cytokine levels (IFN-y, IL-1 (3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, TNF-a) using a cytokine immunoassay that utilizes electrochemiluminescent detection. Synovial cytokine levels were compared between patients with and without positive culture results, and also for differences across procedure type (TSA vs. RCR). Results: Overall, 42% of cases grew at least one positive culture, with no difference in the positive culture rate between procedures (40% vs. 44%, TSA vs. RCR, P =.84). A positive synovial fluid culture was present in only 4 cases. P. acnes was the most commonly cultured organism (34% of cases), followed by Staph epidermidis (6%). The majority of positive cultures were isolated results, with only 18% of cases showing growth of multiple cultures of the same organism, all of which were P. acnes. A history of cortisone injection in the shoul-der was not associated with a significantly higher positive culture rate. Males showed a significantly higher positive culture rate for P. acnes than females overall (49% vs. 12%, P <.001), and for TSA (48% vs. 12%, P=.01) and RCR (50% vs. 12.5%, P=.01) separately. No patient with a positive culture result showed clinical signs of infection postoperatively. In looking at the synovial fluid cytokines, multiple cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) showed significantly higher levels in TSA cases compared to RCR cases, regardless of culture results. Therefore, the relationships between synovial cytokine levels and positive culture results were analyzed for each procedure separately. Synovial cytokines levels were not significantly different when comparing cases with positive culture(s) to those with all negative cultures for either procedure (TSA or RCR), both when looking at positive cultures overall or only P. acnes positive cultures. An increasing number of P. acnes positive tissue cultures per case (1 vs. 2 vs. 3 or more) also did not correlate with increasing levels of any synovial cytokines for either procedure (TSA or RCR). None of the synovial cytokines showed significantly different levels for cases with earlier (<7 days) com-pared with later (>7 days) culture growth for either procedure (TSA or RCR), both when looking at positive cultures overall or only P. acnes positive cultures. Conclusions: Positive cultures can commonly occur with first time shoulder surgery, with similar rates observed between primary TSA and primary RCR. Most positive cultures grew from tissue speci-mens, were P. acnes, and were an isolated positive result, with male gender significantly associated with P. acnes positive cultures. While several synovial cytokines show elevated levels in patients undergo-ing TSA for OA compared to those undergoing RCR without OA, these elevations were not to the levels we have previously reported for shoul-der PJI. The synovial cytokine levels in the current study were not significantly elevated in positive culture cases, regardless of proce-dure type, organism type, number of positive cultures, and days to culture growth. These findings, in combination with prior work showing significantly elevated synovial cytokine levels in revision shoulder arthroplasty cases with positive cultures consistent with PJI, suggest that positive cultures in primary TSA or RCR are not consistent with clinically relevant infection. The culture results could represent either culture contaminants or non-infectious colonization, with the latter explanation supported in the current study by the significant association between male gender and P. acnes positive cultures.

N2  - Purpose To verify the clinical features and the risk factors of rapid progressive osteonecrosis of the humeral head after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery (ARCS). Methods Data and medical records of 24 patients who had rapid progressive collapse of the humeral head after ARCS performed from October 2012 to March 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 8 patients demonstrated no evidence of osteonecrosis of the humeral head preoperatively yet developed rapid progressive collapse of the humeral head within 12 months after ARCS. Results All patients were women with a mean age of 64.0 years (range, 52-74 years), and all of them had surgery on their dominant side. Sudden pain developed at a mean 4 months (range, 0-6 months) after index surgery. The rapid progressive collapse of the humeral head occurred within 12 months after index surgery. No clear risk factor or evidence supporting an association between ARCS and humeral head osteonecrosis was found. Conclusions Although the cause of the rapid progressive humeral head osteonecrosis after ARCS still needs to be established, surgeons should be aware of the possible development of humeral head osteonecrosis after ARCS, especially in older women with dominant arm involvement. Level of Evidence Level IV, prognostic case series.

N2  - Interscalene brachial plexus block is considered the most complete postoperative analgesia after total shoulder arthroplasty. Interscalene brachial plexus block-induced ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paralysis may not be tolerated in patients with preexisting pulmonary disease. Selective distal nerve blocks avoid the risk of phrenic nerve block; however, they may provide incomplete analgesia to the glenohumeral joint. We report a case of combined selective suprascapular and axillary nerve blockade in combination with local infiltration analgesia in a patient with severe lung disease undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty. This case highlights the local infiltration analgesia technique of the shoulder joint and current diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia blocks.

N2  - Background: With the growing population of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs), the demand for shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in this population can be expected to increase. No studies in the literature have examined the outcomes of SA in HSCT patients. Patients and methods: A retrospective review of 11 SAs in 10 patients with previous HSCT was performed. We characterized the clinical outcomes, survivorship, and peri-operative complication rates in patients who underwent SA after receiving a HSCT. We also performed a subanalysis based on implant and transplant type. Results: Seven of ten patients died with average two and five year post-operative patient survival rates of 70% +/− 14% and 47% +/− 17%, respectively. At average follow up of 4.2 years of the seven patients with two year followup, pain and range of motion improved with SA (p = 0.0625–0.2500). At final follow-up, five of seven shoulders were rated as satisfactory or excellent with modified Neer ratings. Two and five year survival rates free of re-operation were 100% +/− 0% and 67% +/− 27%, respectively. There were no other complications. No differences in outcomes were seen based on implant or transplant type besides RSA being associated with greater mortality risk (p = 0.0424, hazard ratio = 10.6). Conclusions: Patients with previous HSCT who undergo SA can expect to have good pain relief, range of motion improvement, subjective satisfaction, and low peri-operative complication rate with appropriate choice of implant. However, surgeons must inform patients about realistic post-operative outcomes given the high post-operative mortality rate. Level of Evidence: Level IV, Prognosis.

N2  - Background Multiple perioperative factors have been implicated in infection risk after shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine surgical site infection (SSI) risk due to medical comorbidities or blood transfusion after primary or revision shoulder arthroplasty. Methods Comprehensive data on medical comorbidities, surgical indication, perioperative transfusion, and SSI were obtained for 707 patients who underwent primary or revision hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty in a single hospital system. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to determine the independent association between allogeneic red blood cell transfusion, medical comorbidities, and SSI after controlling for procedure. Results The SSI rate was 1.9% for primary hemiarthroplasties and 1.3% for primary total shoulder arthroplasties. Among patients without prior shoulder infection, revision arthroplasty or prior open reduction and internal fixation had higher SSI risk than primary arthroplasties (incidence risk ratio [IRR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.84-34.0; P <.001); among primary arthroplasties, SSI risk factors included male gender (IRR, 60.0; CI, 4.39-819; P =.002), rheumatoid arthritis (IRR, 8.63; CI, 1.84-40.4; P =.006), and long-term corticosteroid use (IRR, 37.4; CI, 5.79-242; P <.001). Perioperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion significantly increased SSI risk and was dose dependent (IRR, 1.68 per unit packed red blood cell; CI, 1.21-2.35; P =.002). Conclusion Gender, rheumatoid arthritis, and long-term (>1 year) corticosteroid use affect SSI risk after shoulder arthroplasty. Revision surgery, particularly in the setting of prior infection, increased risk of future infection. Finally, allogeneic red blood cell transfusion increases SSI risk after shoulder arthroplasty in a dose-dependent manner.

N2  - Introduction: Postoperative pain after prosthetic shoulder arthroplasty impacts patient satisfaction and hospital length of stay so that minimizing this is a priority for health care providers and essential for optimizing health care value. Regional anesthesia is a commonly used cornerstone of multimodal perioperative pain management strategy for shoulder surgery. Moreover, the efficacy of regional anesthesia can be extended by continuous catheter infusion of local anesthetics. However, concerns remain regarding the safety of continuous regional anesthesia and comparative studies are lacking. The study purpose was to compare continuous interscalene block with single shot interscalene block for postoperative pain control after primary shoulder arthroplasty, and the hypothesis was that the two interventions would offer similar safety and efficacy. Methods: All patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty by one of two fellowship trained shoulder surgeons at a single busy community hospital were considered for this randomized clinical trial. Eighty-one patients were consented to participate in this study, but of these, 5 patients were withdrawn from the study for various reasons, including inability to be randomized to the continuous interscalene block due to current health status and comorbidities (4 patients), and patient withdrawal of consent on day of surgery (1 patient). The remaining 76 patients were randomly assigned to Group 1: 37 patients receiving single shot interscalene block and Group 2: 39 patients receiving continuous interscalene block. A priori power analysis determined that 33 patients would be needed in each group. All patients underwent preoperative ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Patients undergoing single shot nerve block received a onetime dose of 30 ml 0.5% preservative-free ropivacaine. Patients undergoing continuous nerve block received a single injection of 30 ml 0.5% preservative-free ropivacaine followed by threading an 18 gauge open-tip stimulating catheter under ultrasound guidance. Following confirmation of catheter tip placement, patients received continuous infusion of 8 ml/hr of 0.2% preservative-free ropivacaine, beginning at the conclusion of surgery, and delivered for approximately 55 hours by means of a catheter attached to an elastomeric infusion system. Patients underwent preoperative assessments and daily postoperative queries including 10-point VAS score and a 5 point Likert scale to score overall satisfaction. Postoperative opioid use was carefully recorded and converted to morphine sulfate equivalent to facilitate comparisons. In addition, hospital length of stay, instances of catheter tip withdrawal, and adverse events arising perioperatively were recorded. Results: Thirty-five of the 76 patients were female and 41 were male, and mean age was 68.6 years (SD 8.8 years). Fifty patients (65.8%) underwent anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty, 21 underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and 5 underwent either resurfacing or stemmed hemiarthroplasty. No differences between Groups 1 and 2 were detected at P < .05 level of significance for any of the demographic variables, including age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, ASA level, and duration of surgery. Four patients receiving catheters for continuous infusion subsequently had their catheters pull out prematurely; however, these patients remained in Group 2 because of intent to treat. Pain scores on the first postoperative day (POD#1) were significantly lower in the continuous nerve block group (P = .010) but these subsequently normalized. In addition, opioid use was substantially lower in the continuous nerve block group (15 mg vs. 22.5 mg, P = .003). There was no difference in hospital length of stay (1.4 days vs. 1.8 days, P = .142) with the numbers available. Opioid use and pain were highly correlated on day of surgery as well as on POD #1 and POD #2. Adverse event rates were higher in the continuous catheter group (8/39 vs. 2/37) but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .087). The most common adverse event in the continuous nerve bock group was 3 syncopal episodes, one of which resulted in pacemaker implantation; there were no instances of pneumothorax or catheter tip breakage. Discussion: This study demonstrates that opioid use and pain levels during the first day postoperatively are substantially less following continuous interscalene nerve block than following single shot block. However, this did not translate to a shorter length of stay in the continuous nerve group. In addition, this study demonstrates that experienced anesthesiologists at a community hospital are able to insert interscalene catheters reproducibly and without serious complications. However, the study also demonstrates that the overall rate of adverse events is greater following continuous nerve block. In addition, the rate of catheter tip withdrawal (4/39 = 10.3%) remains too great and must be reduced. Further study is necessary to determine whether the benefits of continuous nerve block justify the higher cost and overall complication rate. In addition, further study will be needed to compare continuous nerve block to other emerging perioperative pain management interventions such as liposomal bupivacaine and various “cocktail” infiltrations.

N2  - Background Recent studies have identified the diagnostic challenge of low-grade infections after shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Infections after nonarthroplasty procedures have not been reported. This study assessed patient-related risk factors, outcomes, and clinical presentation of low-grade infection after open and arthroscopic nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery. Methods The cases of 35 patients presenting with suspected low-grade infection were reviewed. Biopsy specimens taken at revision surgery were cultured in the sterile environment of a class II laminar flow cabinet and incubated for a minimum of 14 days at a specialist orthopedic microbiology laboratory. Patient-related factors (age, occupation, injection), index surgery, and infection characteristics (onset of symptoms, duration to diagnosis, treatment) were analyzed. Results Positive cultures were identified in 21 cases (60.0%), of which 15 were male patients (71%). Of all patients with low-grade infection, 47.6% were male patients between 16 and 35 years of age. Propionibacterium acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were the most common organisms isolated (81.1% [n = 17] and 23.8% [n = 5], respectively). Of 14 negative culture cases, 9 were treated with early empirical antibiotics (64.3%); 7 patients reported symptomatic improvement (77.8%). Of 5 patients treated with late empirical antibiotics, 4 stated improvement. Patients presented with symptoms akin to resistant postoperative frozen shoulder (persistent pain and stiffness, unresponsive to usual treatments). Conclusion Young male patients are at greatest risk for low-grade infections after arthroscopic and open nonarthroplasty shoulder surgery. P. acnes was the most prevalent organism. Patients presented with classic postoperative frozen shoulder symptoms, resistant to usual treatments. Interestingly, 78.6% of patients with negative cultures responded positively to empirical treatment.

N2  - Multimodal pain management has been advocated in patients experiencing acute pain after surgical procedures due to tissue damage and the subsequent inflammatory response. For patients undergoing shoulder surgeries, studies have definitively shown that interscalene blocks (ISBs) via single-injection or continuous infusion can reduce the total opioid consumption and can lower pain scores after surgery. In some cases, ISBs can be used as the sole anesthetic during shoulder surgeries and spare patients of receiving general anesthesia. However, clinicians should be fully aware of potential pulmonary complications of ISBs and weigh the risk-benefit ratio in patients with limited pulmonary reserve.

N2  - Background and Aims: Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare, etiologically heterogeneous syndrome with an incidence of 1-5/1.000.000. It is characterized by acute or subacute onset of bilateral neurological symptoms due to spinal cord inflammation, without any proof of spinal cord injury, lesion, or tumor, or pressure phenomena. There is limited information on perioperative management of patients with TM. Methods: A 62-year-old female, diagnosed as a case of TM, with a rotator cuff tear, was scheduled for total shoulder arthroplasty. She reported the sudden onset of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness and bladder dysfunction one year ago. A diagnosis of TM was made and she was started on intravenous and later on oral steroids, with only partial improvement of motor power. Intravenous midazolam 3mg was given as premedication. After obtaining informed consent, we performed ultrasound-guided interscalene nerve block (40 ml ropivacaine 0,5%/8 mg dexamethasone). Results: The patient remained calm throughout the 90 min surgical procedure. An episode of hypotension-bradycardia occurred during placement in the beach-chair position, managed easily with ephedrine. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged five days later. Conclusions: Our case serves as a reminder of this rare condition and its anaesthetic implications. Anaesthetic concerns include autonomic dysreflexia with uncontrolled sympathetic outflow, hyperkalaemia following use of suxamethonium and myopathy associated with TM, which affects the action of muscle relaxants. Consequently, performing a nerve block for surgical anaesthesia, where appropriate, instead of general anaesthesia, seems a safe anaesthetic choice in these patients.

N2  - Background and Aims: It has long been recognized that an increased risk exists for respiratory complications in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease following interscalene block (ISB) because of associated phrenic nerve blockade. However these patients would otherwise benefit the most from peripheral nerve blocks, as general anesthesia and systemic opioids could further compromise ventilation and oxigenation. Diaphragm-sparing alternatives to classical ISB afford adequate postoperative analgesia with low incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis, but have not proved to be as effective in providing adequate surgical anesthesia especially for major surgical procedures. These include ISB with decreased local anesthetic volume and concentration or injection away from the brachial plexus. Methods: A 78-year-old male patient, smoker, 120 pack-years, with left proximal humeral fracturewas scheduled for total shoulder arthroplasty. His medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving long-term oxygen therapy and obstructive sleep apnea using CPAP. We performed an ultrasound-guided ISB, posterior to C5-C6 roots, with 5ml of ropivacaine 0,5%. Light sedation with midazolam (1mg) and an intravenous ketamine infusion (0,4mg/kg/h) was maintained throughout the 3h procedure. Results: On the basis of the available laboratory and clinical data, the patient had no evidence of respiratory impairment. He was discharged to the ward on the same day and discharged home 2 days later. Conclusions: Performing an ISB with meticulous injection of a low volume of local anesthetic allowed a high-risk pulmonary patient to undergo a major surgical procedure avoiding the drawbacks of both the phrenic nerve blockade and general anesthesia.

N2  - Background and Aims: Shoulder hemiarthroplasty can be performed under general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia or a combination of both. Regional anaesthesia alone can be extremely useful in elderly patients in whom general anaesthesia can be detrimental.We present two cases of elderly patientswith pulmonary disorders operated under regional anaesthesiawith uneventful preoperative period. Methods: Case 1: 64 years old, ASA 3 male with hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bilateral crepitations, respiratory rate 16/min, SpO2 92%on room air. Case 2: 70 years old, ASA3 male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and bronchiectasis with bilateral coarse crepitations, respiratory rate 15/min, SpO2 94%on room air. Both cases, ultrasound guided inter scalene brachial plexus block was given with 7ml of 0.5% L-bupivacaine in lateral position. In addition, superficial cervical plexus block and local infiltration in deltopectoral groove were given. Intravenous dexamethasone 8mg was given. No difficulty in breathing noted. Electrocardiogram, Pulse rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate were monitored throughout the peri-operative period. Results: Surgery commenced after confirmation of anaesthesia of the operative site. The two patients did not require any supplementation with general anaesthesia. Shoulder support provided with immobiliser postoperatively. Both the cases had an uneventful peri-operative period without respiratory complications. Oral intake commenced immediately in the recovery room. Conclusions: Good operative conditions can be provided with low dose inter scalene brachial plexus, superficial cervical plexus and intercostobrachial nerve blocks and excellent postoperative analgesia.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of musculoskeletal shoulder sonography (US) on clinical decision making.
RESULTS: A total of 935 patient examinations met inclusion criteria. Of 935 patients, 591 (63.2%) had a post-US treatment plan that differed from pre-US treatment, showing a statistically significant impact on patient treatment (P < .001). In 744 of the 935 examinations (79.6%), the treating physician initially prescribed conservative therapy as a treatment plan; 423 of those 744 patients (56.9%) were subsequently prescribed a more invasive form of treatment. Of the remaining 191 of 935 patients (20.4%) initially treated with invasive treatment, 101 (52.9%) received a change in the treatment plan after the US examinations, with 46 patients (24.1%) relegated to noninvasive treatment. Sonography also played a role in surgical planning, with 25 studies (2.7%) specifically performed to evaluate rotator cuff integrity when deciding between conventional and reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal shoulder US has a substantial impact on clinical decision making and patient treatment.
METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study received Institutional Review Board approval with a waiver of informed consent. Consecutive musculoskeletal shoulder US examinations ordered over a 12-month period were retrospectively reviewed. The medical records of each patient were analyzed, recording immediate pre- and post-US treatment plans. Treatment plans were categorized as follows: 1, no further treatment; 2, conservative management/physical therapy; 3, therapeutic injection; 4, surgical intervention; 5, change in diagnosis; and 6, need additional imaging. Data were analyzed by nonparametric statistical methods.

N2  - Optimal perioperative pain management facilitates postoperative ambulation and rehabilitation. The detrimental consequences of inadequately treated pain are well documented; however, postoperative pain control remains suboptimal. Opioids still remain the mainstay in managing perioperative pain. The conflicting evidence from the meta-analysis assessing various analgesic interventions creates confusion amongst clinicians. Furthermore, the available guidelines provide broad recommendations, which may not always apply to specific surgical procedures making it is difficult for clinicians to implement the information in day-to-day practice. The best approach to achieve optimal pain control is to develop procedure-specific and patient-specific pain management strategies and incorporate them in clinical pathways. The first step is to identify patients at risk of disproportionate pain to the surgical insult (i.e., high responders). The predictors of severe postoperative pain include age, gender, presence of preoperative pain, inappropriate patient expectations, and psychological factors such as low selfesteem, severe anxiety, major depressive disorder, and pain catastrophizing or hypervigilance. Therefore, patient education is a crucial component of an optimal pain management strategy. Another factor that is commonly overlooked is opioid-induced acute tolerance and hyperalgesia caused by high intraoperative opioid use. Therefore, intraoperative opioid dose must be limited. Multimodal analgesia has been accepted as the best approach to pain management; however, the number and choice of analgesic interventions should depend upon the type of surgical procedures and expected postoperative pain. Furthermore, risk benefit of the interventions should be considered. Local/regional analgesia should be utilized as the principal method in the multimodal analgesic technique. Peripheral nerve blocks are optimal for extremity surgery; however, the duration of a single-local anesthetic injection is limited (~6-12 h) and the abrupt termination of analgesia may result in rebound pain. Although additives have been used to prolong the duration of a nerve block, their routine use is not recommended due to a high risk/benefit ratio. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks extend the duration of analgesia, but their placement can be technically challenging and associated with management problems. Overall, patients undergoing major upper extremity surgery (e.g., shoulder arthroplasty, rotator cuff repair, and elbow arthroplasty) could receive brachial plexus block. Patients undergoing major knee surgery could receive adductor canal block, while those undergoing major foot and ankle surgery could receive popliteal sciatic nerve block. In recent years, field blocks such as transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks are increasingly used in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. However, they have no role in laparoscopic procedures. Surgical site infiltration provides excellent analgesia with no potential adverse events, and should be utilized whenever possible. However, it is imperative to ensure that all layers of the surgical incision are meticulously infiltrated with high volume and low concentration local anesthetic solution. Local/regional analgesia should be supplemented with a combination of paracetamol, traditional non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 specific inhibitors, and dexamethasone (8-10mg, IV), assuming there are no contraindications. Combination of paracetamol in appropriate doses (i.e., 1 g every 6 h, maximum 4 g per day) and NSAIDs or COX-2 specific inhibitors provides greater opioid-sparing effects compared with either drug alone. Non-opioid analgesics should be administered at the appropriate time (preoperative or intraoperative) to provide sufficient analgesia in the early recovery period, and continued in the postoperative period until the surgical inflammation is resolved. Opioids are used as “rescue” analgesics on an “as needed” basis rather than on a scheduled basis. Weak opioids (e.g., tramadol) may be used if the pain intensity remains to be moderate, while strong opioids (e.g., hydrocodone and oxycodone) may be used for moderate-tohigh intensity postoperative pain. Analgesic adjuncts such as intravenous lidocaine infusion, ketamine, and gabapentinoids are generally reserved for select patient population and/or surgical procedures. There is no role for intravenous lidocaine infusion in ambulatory surgery. Similarly, there appears to be no role for a single bolus dose of ketamine in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Gabapentinoids may be used in surgical procedures with a high propensity of persistent postoperative pain, but with great caution and at the lowest possible dose. These drugs are best administered for at least to 7-10 days postoperatively. Other non-pharmacologic therapies that could be offered as a part of a multimodal analgesia approach includes music therapy, which has been proven to reduce pain and anxiety in the postoperative period as well as biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral modalities.

N2  - Background Alternative techniques have been developed to address pain after shoulder arthroplasty and are well documented. We evaluated the effect of adding intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine and intravenous dexamethasone during shoulder arthroplasty. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 2 consecutive cohorts undergoing elective shoulder arthroplasty. The 24 patients in cohort 1 and the 31 patients in cohort 2 received perioperative multimodal management with preoperative and postoperative intravenous and oral narcotics, gabapentin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and single-injection interscalene block. Cohort 2 also received 8 to 10 mg of intravenous dexamethasone intraoperatively after the skin incision and liposomal bupivacaine injected at surgery. Patients who did and did not use preoperative narcotics were analyzed together and separately. We evaluated hospitalization length of stay, narcotic use, and visual analog scale pain before and after the change in the perioperative protocol. Results Cohort 1 was hospitalized longer (2 vs. 1 day; P < .001), required more narcotics on postoperative day 1 (21.0 vs. 10.0 mg; P < .001) and days 0 and 1 cumulatively (30.5 vs. 17.5 mg; P = .001), and had more pain on postoperative days 0 (6.5 vs. 3.5; P < .001) and 1 (7.5 vs. 3.5; P < .001) than cohort 2. In patients using preoperative narcotics, cohort 2 had less pain on postoperative day 1 (3.5 vs. 7.0; P = .006), less cumulative narcotic use (20 vs. 58.5 mg; P = .03), and shorter hospitalization (1 vs. 2 days; P = .052) than cohort 1. Conclusion These changes to the perioperative shoulder arthroplasty protocol decreased hospitalization length of stay, narcotic requirement, and pain.

N2  - Background. The incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis with continuous interscalene brachial plexus block (CISB) can approach 100%. We tested the hypothesis that extrafascial placement of the catheter tip reduces the rate of hemidiaphragmatic paresis compared with intrafascial tip placement for CISB while providing effective analgesia. Methods. Seventy patients undergoing elective major shoulder surgery under general anaesthesia were randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided CISB plexus block for analgesia with the catheter tip placed either within (intrafascial group) or immediately outside (extrafascial group) the brachial plexus sheath midway between the levels of C5 and C6. Catheters were bolus dosed with ropivacaine 0.5% 20 ml before surgery, followed by an infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at 4ml h1 for the first 2 days after surgery. The primary outcome was hemidiaphragmatic paresis measured by M-mode ultrasonography on postoperative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and rest pain scores. Results. The incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis on POD 1 was significantly reduced in the extrafascial group {intrafascial, 41% [95% confidence interval (CI) 25-59%]; extrafascial, 15% (95% CI 5-32%); P1/40.01}. We were unable to detect a difference between groups in any of the functional respiratory outcomes or in rest pain scores [numerical rating scale (1-10): Intrafascial, 3 (95% CI 2-3); extrafascial, 3 (95% CI: 2-4); P1/40.93] on POD 1. Conclusions. Placement of the catheter tip immediately outside of the brachial plexus sheath reduced the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis on POD 1 associated with ultrasound-guided CISB while providing effective analgesia after major shoulder surgery. Our results do not support the routine placement of the catheter tip within the brachial plexus sheath for CISB.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks offer advantages over single-injection blocks, including extended analgesia and reduction in opioid consumption. These benefits require that the perineural catheter remain intact for the duration of the planned local anesthetic infusion. Mechanical displacement of catheters, leaking, and consequent failure are known complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate continuous perineural catheter tip-to-nerve apposition in vivo over 48 hours comparing 2 different simple fixation strategies. METHODS: Subjects presenting for a continuous interscalene nerve block were randomized to perineural catheter fixation with 1 of 2 types of adhesive: Dermabond (2-octylcyanoacrylate) or Mastisol (alcohol 23A, gum mastic, storax, and methyl salicylate), covered with a simple transparent dressing. The primary outcome was the evaluation of catheter-to-nerve apposition maintenance over 48 hours via both a blinded ultrasound evaluation of local anesthetic distribution and a blinded clinical assessment. Secondary outcomes included leakage at the catheter site, pain scores, opioid consumption, catheter-to-skin migration at the insertion site, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixty-six subjects were recruited and randomized to compare adhesive group catheter tip-to-nerve apposition on postoperative day 2 (POD 2). Within the intention-to-treat cohort, a statistically significant decrease of perineural catheter tip-to-nerve apposition in the Mastisol group (64.7%) compared with the Dermabond group (90.6%) on POD 2 (odds ratios [OR] 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.75; P =.012) was observed. Similar results were observed on POD 1 (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.03-1.38; P = NS) and POD 2 (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02-0.97; P =.008) within the as-treated cohort. Catheter leakage (OR 67; 95% CI 7.3-589) and median catheter migration difference at the skin insertion site (2.0 cm; 95% CI 0.5-2.5) were also significantly greater in the Mastisol group than in the Dermabond group from POD 0 to POD 2 (P <.001). Median postoperative opioid consumption difference in morphine equivalents (3.2 mg; 95% CI - 9.0 to 14.2) was not significantly different between the Dermabond and the Mastisol groups through POD 2 (P =.542). CONCLUSIONS: Perineural catheter fixation with Dermabond in continuous interscalene nerve block improves maintenance of catheter-to-nerve apposition when compared with Mastisol.

N2  - Subcoracoid impingement syndrome is a rare and underrecognized cause of anterior shoulder pain. Currently, subcoracoid impingement syndrome is understood to involve impingement of anatomic structures such as the subcoracoid bursa and subscapularis tendon within the coracohumeral space, and there are no reports of sonographic findings in subcoracoid impingement syndrome other than the impingement of thickened subscapularis bursa. Here we report a case of subcoracoid impingement syndrome, including a novel sonographic finding, arthroscopic findings, and a proposed pathophysiology. Level of Evidence V

N2  - Objective Inconclusive findings about infection risks, importantly the use of immunosuppressive medications in patients who have undergone large-joint total joint arthroplasty, challenge efforts to provide evidence-based perioperative total joint arthroplasty recommendations to improve surgical outcomes. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe risk factors for developing a post-operative infection in patients undergoing TJA of a large joint (total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or total shoulder arthroplasty) by identifying clinical and demographic factors, including the use of high-risk medications (i.e., prednisone and immunosuppressive medications) and diagnoses [i.e., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), gout, obesity, and diabetes mellitus] that are linked to infection status, controlling for length of follow-up. Methods A retrospective, case-control study (N = 2212) using de-identified patient health claims information from a commercially insured, U.S. dataset representing 15 million patients annually (from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009) was conducted. Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate logistic regression were used. Results Male gender (OR = 1.42, p < 0.001), diagnosis of RA (OR = 1.47, p = 0.031), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.38, p = 0.001), obesity (OR = 1.66, p < 0.001) or gout (OR = 1.95, p = 0.001), and a prescription for prednisone (OR = 1.59, p < 0.001) predicted a post-operative infection following total joint arthroplasty. Persons with post-operative joint infections were significantly more likely to be prescribed allopurinol (p = 0.002) and colchicine (p = 0.006); no significant difference was found for the use of specific disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and TNF-α inhibitors. Conclusion High-risk, post-operative joint infection groups were identified allowing for precautionary clinical measures to be taken.

N2  - Glenohumeral arthritis in young patients is a challenging clinical problem without a gold standard for either nonoperative or operative treatment. These patients often have high activity levels and high expectations, are employed, and have a long life expectancy. There are few studies that specifically examine treatment outcomes in young patients. While many treatment options can yield short-term success, eventual failures at mid-term and long-term follow-up are expected. Because of these factors, treatment decisions are particularly complex.

N2  - Background and Objectives: We examined whether liposome bupivacaine (Exparel) given in the interscalene brachial plexus block lowers pain in the setting of multimodal postoperative pain management for major shoulder surgery. Methods: Fifty-two adult patients were randomized to receive either 5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine HCl immediately followed by 10 mL of liposome bupivacaine 133 mg (n = 26) or 15 mL of 0.25% standard bupivacaine alone (n = 26) in interscalene brachial plexus block. The primary outcome (worst pain in the first postoperative week) was assessed by the Modified Brief Pain Inventory short form. Secondary outcomes were overall satisfaction with analgesia (OBAS), functionality of the surgical arm, sleep duration, time to first opioid (tramadol) request and opioid consumption (mEq), sensory-motor block characteristics, and the occurrence of adverse effects. Results: Worst pain was lower in patients given liposome bupivacaine added to standard bupivacaine than in patients given standard bupivacaine alone (generalized estimating equation [GEE] estimated marginal mean values, 3.6 ± 0.3 vs 5.3 ± 0.4 points on the Numeric Rating Scale, respectively, although the effect was modest, 1.6 ± 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.5). Total OBAS scores indicated greater satisfaction (GEE estimated marginal mean values, 1.8 ± 0.3 vs 3.3 ± 0.4 on total OBAS, respectively, with modest effect, difference, 1.4 ± 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.4). There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Liposome bupivacaine added to standard bupivacaine may lower pain and enhance patient's satisfaction in the first postoperative week even in the setting of multimodal analgesia for major shoulder surgery.

N2  - We present a case of supraclinoid internal carotid artery dissection. Eleven months prior, the patient developed isolated periorbital pain and was diagnosed with giant-cell arteritis with iritis. The patient experienced recurrent spells concerning for transient ischaemic attacks and was transferred to our institution for endovascular intervention after head CT revealed an embolic infarct with a 'dense middle cerebral artery sign.' Digital subtraction angiography was negative for occlusion, instead demonstrating luminal stenosis and poststenotic dilatation. He subsequently experienced acute neurological decline secondary to massive subarachnoid haemorrhage. Non-invasive vascular imaging revealed an intimal flap and a pseudoaneurysm at the site of luminal stenosis, confirming our suspicion for intracranial carotid artery dissection. Given the moribund clinical state, the family opted to withdraw care, and he quickly expired.

N2  - Propionibacterium species are associated with normal skin flora and cultures may be dismissed as contaminants. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of septic arthritis following shoulder arthroplasty and arthrotomy. We identified three cases of Propionibacterium septic arthritis in native joints mimicking atypical osteoarthritis and review the literature, clinical course, and treatment of 18 cases. Two cases of Propionibacterium acne in native knee joints and one in a sternoclavicular joint are described. A literature search for Propionibacterium septic arthritis was performed. Clinical course, treatment, and outcome are reviewed for all cases. Our three cases were combined with 15 cases from the literature. Fourteen cases showed few signs of acute infection, slow culture growth, and delayed diagnosis. In 3 cases an early culture was dismissed as a contaminant. Six cases were reported as caused by recent arthrocentesis. Fifteen cases were cured with antibiotics, although 5 of these 15 also required surgical intervention. Two patients were diagnosed while undergoing surgery for osteoarthritis. Four patients required arthroplasty and two of our patients will require arthroplasty for good functional results. Propionibacterium as a cause of septic arthritis in native joints demonstrates few signs of acute infection, presents with prolonged course, and is often misdiagnosed or unsuspected. Anaerobic growth may be delayed or missed altogether, and outcomes are consequently poor. Consider Propionibacterium septic arthritis in atypical osteoarthritis prior to arthroplasty.

N2  - Introduction Hemidiaphragmatic paralysis secondary to phrenic nerve block following interscalene injection has been reported to occur in the majority of cases (1), resulting in a reduction in FVC and FEV1 (2). As such, impaired pulmonary function is an expected sequela of standard interscalene brachial plexus blocks. Acute respiratory failure following brachial plexus block has been reported (3), and patients with poor pulmonary function are advised against interscalene blocks (4). Although patients with advanced pulmonary disease may benefit from regional anesthesia, caution is warranted when considering techniques above the clavicle that may alter the risk:benefit assessment. We present a case report of patient with advanced chronic obstructive lung disease demonstrating how point of care ultrasound can facilitate perioperative regional anesthesia decision making. Materials and methods (NA for case report) Our patient was a 75-year-old female with COPD (on 2L/min O2) and pulmonary hypertension (PAS 61 mmhg) scheduled for a total shoulder arthroplasty. She endorsed a history of dyspnea at rest. Her oxygen saturation by pulse-oximeter was 96% upon arrival, which improved to 100% with administration of 3L NC. After discussion of the risks and benefits of regional anesthesia, we proceeded with a continuous interscalene nerve block. Following ultrasound confirmation of correct needle location, 10ml of 3% chloroprocaine was injected. A catheter was then threaded 2 cm in a peri-plexus location. No additional local anesthetic was given through the catheter. Our goal was to generate a short-acting block and to assess the patient clinically and with ultrasound. Fifteen minutes after the chloroprocaine administration, the diaphragm was visualized with ultrasound. We demonstrated lack of ipsilateral diaphragmatic excursion during quiet breathing and deep breathing using both 2D imaging and M-mode to confirm phrenic nerve paralysis. The patient's respiratory status was monitored with continuous pulse-oximetry. Additionally, the patient was instructed to report any subjective change. Results/Case report In the operating room, general endotracheal anesthesia was initiated. One hour from surgery start, 15mLs of 0.5% ropivicaine was bolused through the catheter. No intra-operative opioid was given and she was extubated without difficulty. In the PACU, she remained on 4L NC to maintain oxygen saturations >92%, and was without complaints of dyspnea. A continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was initiated at 4 ml/hr. The patient required no narcotic and reported no pain. On postoperative day (POD 1) the infusion was weaned to bolus only and the catheter was removed on POD 2. Discussion Here we illustrated an approach to performing a provocative diagnositic maneuver prior to surgery in order to assess the extent of respiratory dysfunction caused by block-induced hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis in a pulmonary patient without committing to potentially prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation. Utilization of short-acting local anesthetic for the initial block demonstrated that our patient's respiratory status remained stable despite the confirmed hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Ultrasound allowed for visualization of, or lack thereof, of diaphragm excursion post-block; which was crucial in proving that this expected change had occurred and that the patient was able to tolerate this loss of function. This allowed us to confidently utilize the catheter, allowing for an opioid free course.

N2  - Introduction Postsurgical analgesia following total shoulder arthroplasty is typically managed with interscalene peripheral nerve block (IPNB). Insufficient postsurgical analgesia is associated with risks such as a decrease in physical therapy capability, delayed ambulation, decreased patient satisfaction, increased length of hospital stay, and increased cost. Although systemic opioids decrease pain in post-surgical patients, such medications are often associated with unpleasant side effects and/or complications. Furthermore, the motor block that can occur with continuous PNB's may impair rehabilitation. Liposomal encapsulated bupivicaine has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for limited surgical wound infiltration to provide postoperative analgesia. We review our experience of 4 patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and received a wound infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine (WILP) as a component of their multimodal analgesia treatment plan. Materials and methods (NA for case report) Between July 14, 2016 and August 30, 2016, 4 patients underwent total shoulder arthroplasty. All patients underwent local infiltration with 20 mL of 1.3% liposomal bupivacaine by the surgeon at the conclusion of the operation. Each patient also received a pre-operative single injection IPNB using either 1.5% mepivicaine or 0.25% ropivicaine (in total volumes ranging from 15 mL to 25 mL). Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), Post- Operative Day (POD) #1, POD #2, and POD #3 (when available) pain scores (on a 0-10 verbal scale), adverse reactions, total opioid use oral morphine equivalent units (MEQ's, defined as conversion of all opioids used to an oral morphine equivalent dosage), and all adjuvant pain medications utilized were recorded. The primary end point was pain intensity through POD #2, as measured by verbal pain scores. Secondary end points included postoperative opioid consumption, adverse events, and overall patient satisfaction. Data collection was via retrospective chart review. All data analysis was descriptive in nature. Results/Case report All patients were ASA Physical Status 2 or 3. Overall opioid use decreased over the study period, as did pain scores. The highest average pain score recorded at any time during the hospital stay was 7. The length of hospital stay for all patients was 2 to 3 days. All patients used at least 1 type of adjuvant (non-narcotic pain medication) during the hospitalization. The MEQ usage was trending down over the study period. The average pain score peaked for all patients on POD#1 at 5.8. The overall trend for average pain scores was down trending over the duration of hospital stay for the study group. Discussion A previous study comparing a single injection IPNB with WILP show no pain or MEQ difference between the 2 groups. This case series evaluated the combination of a single injection IPNB and a WILP for post-operative pain in TSA and found no benefit compare to the single modality from that prior study. This pilot case series is limited by is design, but the limited benefit of the technique resulted in reverting back our practice to continuous IPNB for TSA pain management.

N2  - Introduction Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are often combined with intravenous sedation, general anesthesia, or neuraxial anesthesia. It is not clear which of these accompaniments most improves the patient experience. Neuraxial anesthesia is often considered to have better outcomes, such as minimized opioids, improved analgesia and reduced nausea. These presumed advantages may also be achieved by combining PNBs with general anesthesia. This study created a recovery profile based on factors comprising patient satisfaction. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is significantly associated with patient dissatisfaction, but evidence of nausea after regional anesthesia is not typically based on standardized assessment criteria. This study provides standardized assessment of nausea and postoperative quality of recovery after orthopedic surgery in patients receiving nerve blocks, with intravenous sedation, general anesthesia, or neuraxial anesthesia. Materials and methods (NA for case report) This observational, prospective cohort study received approval from the hospital Institutional Review Board. Patients were enrolled in three groups: Spinal/Block, General/Block and Sedation/Block. The Spinal/Block Group (foot and ankle surgery) received sciatic and adductor canal nerve block with 0.25% bupivacaine, plus spinal anesthesia. The General/Block Group (shoulder arthroplasty) received interscalene block with 0.5% bupivacaine, plus general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask airway, sevoflurane and propofol. The Sedation/Block Group (shoulder arthroplasty) received interscalene block plus intravenous sedation using propofol. Sedation for blocks was midazolam, propofol and ketamine in all groups. All patients received ondansetron and dexamethasone. Groups were compared on the primary outcome of incidence and intensity of nausea at 1 and 2 hours after surgery on an 11-point Likert scale. Multidimensional recovery was measured by the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) across physiologic, nociceptive, activities of daily living and emotional domains at 1 and 2 hours after surgery (T60 and T120) and on postoperative day (POD) 1. Results/Case report Fifteen patients per group were included in the study. There was no evidence of a difference in unadjusted incidence of nausea or severity of nausea between General/Block and Sedation/Block Groups (Table 1). No patients reported emesis. There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients who reported PQRS scores equal to baseline or better between General/Block and Sedation/Block Groups in any of the domains at 1 or 2 hours after surgery or on POD 1. Discussion Peripheral nerve blocks, given with an opioid sparing anesthetic and prophylactic antiemetics, are associated with a low incidence of nausea of mild to moderate intensity. This was seen regardless of whether combined with intravenous sedation, spinal anesthesia, or general anesthesia. Overall, PQRS scores rates of recovery were high in all groups and followed trends based on complexity of surgery and type of anesthesia. Randomized controlled trials are needed to address whether the choice of sedation, spinal, or general anesthesia influences nausea or postoperative quality of recovery in the presence of adequate peripheral nerve blockade. One such study is underway at the authors' institution, comparing readiness for discharge between ambulatory foot and ankle surgery receiving PNBs with either general or spinal anesthesia.

N2  - Case: We describe the case of a 66-year-old man who sustained a nondisplaced radial neck fracture and subsequently developed a symptomatic nonunion. After a period of unsuccessful conservative treatment, a radial head resection was performed. Conclusion: Radial neck fractures, unlike their radial head counterparts, have a low rate of nonunion. Our patient's only positive risk factor was age, but he developed a nonunion. At the 2-year follow-up after excision of the radial head, there was a lack of proximal migration of the radius during axial loading, demonstrating a positive outcome without the need for replacement of the radial head.

N2  - Background A subset of patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears present with retained overhead elevation and pain as their primary complaint. Our aim was to evaluate the outcomes of partial arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with biceps tenotomy and to report the failure rate of this procedure for patients with >5 years of follow-up. Methods Thirty-four patients underwent partial rotator cuff repair and biceps tenotomy for treatment of a massive rotator cuff tear. Patients had preoperative active forward elevation >120° and no radiographic evidence of glenohumeral arthritis. Patients were followed up clinically and radiographically, and 28 patients had a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Failure was defined as an American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score of <70, loss of active elevation >90°, or revision to reverse shoulder arthroplasty during the study period. Results Patients demonstrated improvements in average preoperative to postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (46.6 to 79.3 [P < .001]) and Simple Shoulder Test scores (5.7 to 9.1 [P < .001]) along with decrease in visual analog scale for pain scores (6.9 to 1.9 [P < .001]). No significant change in forward elevation (168° to 154° [P = .07]), external rotation (38° to 39° [P = 1.0]), or internal rotation (84% to 80% [P = 1.0]) was identified; 36% of patients had progression of the Hamada stage. The failure rate was 29%; 75% of patients were satisfied with their index procedure. Conclusion Partial rotator cuff repair and biceps tenotomy for patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears with retained overhead elevation and pain as the primary complaint produced reasonable outcomes at midterm follow-up of at least 5 years.

N2  - Background and Objectives There are multiple risk factors for developing perioperative nerve injury (PNI). Perioperative nerve injury after peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) is rare. Exposure to systemic chemotherapy may cause peripheral neuropathy, but its role as a risk factor for PNI after PNB is unknown. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of PNI in patients undergoing PNB as part of extremity surgery after prior exposure to systemic chemotherapy. Methods All patients aged 18 years or older who received systemic chemotherapy and subsequently underwent PNB were identified. The primary outcome was defined as the presence of new or worsened PNI documented within 3 months of the procedural date. Cases of PNI were independently reviewed by 3 investigators, and the etiology of all PNI cases were categorized as possibly or unlikely related to the PNB. Results A total of 216 PNB (165 lower extremity blocks, 51 upper extremity blocks) were performed in 186 patients previously exposed to chemotherapy; 4 cases met criteria for PNI (2.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.8%-5.4%). One case of PNI was possibly related to PNB (0.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1%-3.0%) and 3 cases were unlikely related to PNB. Complete recovery occurred in 3 cases, with partial recovery occurring in 1. Conclusions The overall incidence of PNI in this cohort (2.2%) was not different than baseline risk established in large cohort studies. Perioperative nerve injury was possibly attributable to the PNB in 0.5% of patients. However, in the absence of a control group of surgical patients who previously received systemic chemotherapy without regional anesthesia, we cannot determine whether the higher incidence of neurologic injury is secondary to the surgical procedure, the anesthetic technique, the natural progression of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, or a combination of factors and the relative contribution of each.

N2  - This prospective comparative clinical study was performed to evaluate the effect of triamcinolone when added to bupivacaine during brachial plexus blockade in patients undergoing shoulder surgery. Interscalene brachial plexus blocks were performed on 910 patients before shoulder surgery. Of the patients, 574 were randomly allocated to receive steroids added to the injected local anesthetic and 336 patients received local anesthetic without steroids. All patients were followed prospectively to evaluate the rate of successful anesthesia, duration of anesthesia, side effects of the block, adverse events, and persistent neurologic complications associated with interscalene brachial plexus block. Patients who received steroids had statistically longer pain relief than those who did not receive steroids (P<.001). No difference was found in adverse events, complications, or side effects. Compared with blocks performed without steroids, a statistically longer duration of block analgesia occurred with the addition of steroids to the local anesthetic solution during brachial plexus blockade. Rates of side effects, adverse events, and persistent neurologic complications were similar between the groups.

N2  - Introduction: Relief of postoperative pain is an important issue. Adequate treatment is necessary not only to meet patients' expectations and demands, but also from an economical health care perspective: Chronic pain is a major health care problem in Europe 1 and there is increasing evidence and growing consensus that severe postoperative pain facilitates the development of chronic pain, impeding successful rehabilitation and a timely resumption of labour. 2,3 The importance of adequate postoperative pain relief has been recognized by health care professionals for several decades, pain protocols and acute pain services have been introduced, but despite these developments many patients still suffer severe pain following surgery. 4-7 Especially patients undergoing spinal/back or extremity surgery have a high prevalence of moderate to severe pain. 6 Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Postoperative Pain: Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) play a major role in the management of postoperative pain. Although every technical intervention has not only benefits but also drawbacks, there is little dispute that an adequately placed PNB provides unparalleled postoperative analgesia. Technical developments such as the use of ultrasound have helped to advance the utilization of PNB's worldwide and nowadays PNB's have a prominent place in the armamentarium of the anaesthesiologist. Not withstanding the benefits of multimodal analgesia and the development of newer analgesic drugs with a better risk/benefit profile, PNB's have become the first choice for postoperative analgesia following extremity surgery in many anaesthetic departments involved in orthopaedic surgery. Postoperative pain has two important dimensions: Intensity and duration. Single shot PNB's come particularly into play when the intensity is expected to be severe and the duration of severity relatively short, i.e. shorter than the duration of analgesia of the PNB. With single shot PNB's, the duration of analgesia depends on the type of PNB and the pharmacokinetic profile of the local anaesthetic used; however, with most PNB's using long-acting local anaesthetics, the duration is limited to around 15-20 h in the vast majority of patients. For many patients and procedures this is sufficient; pain intensity is high at the conclusion of surgery and is expected to gradually diminish over time, so that when the PNB is wearing off, pain intensity has sufficiently lessened to be treated adequately with other means such as oral analgesics. However, this strategy does not always work. Patients are not alike, and certain operations are known for severe postoperative pain of several days' duration. Examples are shoulder arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the ankle and/or foot. For the majority of these patients a single shot PNB will not provide sufficient analgesia and may even have an adverse effect when the PNB is wearing off, usually in the middle of the night: The pain is still intense, and the middle of the night is not the most appropriate moment for aggressive pain treatment. In these situations, there is a need for longer acting PNB's; the question at hand is if this is best achieved by adding adjuvants to the local anaesthetic aimed at extending the duration of analgesia, or by a continuous PNB using a catheter. Adjuvants: Several drugs have been studied as adjuvants to local anaesthetics, the most popular being epinephrine, dexamethasone, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, buprenorphine, tramadol, morphine, and fentanyl. A recent systematic review concluded that of these potential adjuvants buprenorphine, clonidine, dexamethasone, dexmedetomidine and magnesium are clearly associated with extended duration of PNB's. 8 Epinephrine: Epinephrine is one of the most widely used adjuvants to local anaesthetics. A primary reason is that it acts as a marker for accidental intravenous administration, thereby reducing the risk of an inadvertent intravascular injection and hence systemic toxicity. Because of its vasoconstrictive properties it delays systemic uptake and prolongs local anaesthetic action; this is certainly true for the short- and intermediate acting local anaesthetics, but not for the long acting local anaesthetics such as ropivacaine. 9,10 From the perspective of prolonging the duration of analgesia, epinephrine is therefore not a suitable adjunct. In addition, there is growing concern that because of its vasoconstrictive properties, epinephrine may enhance the risk of nerve damage. 11 Buprenorphine: Buprenorphine has been studied as an additive to lidocaine, mepivacaine, (levo)bupivacaine 8 and ropivacaine, 12 prolonging the duration of analgesia in all studies. Side effects include a higher incidence of PONV. Clonidine: Clonidine has been studied as an adjuvant to lidocaine, (levo) bupivacaine and ropivacaine, 8 prolonging the duration of analgesia in all studies. Side effects include hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. Dexamethasone: A reviewof six studies showed that dexamethasone 8-10mg added to (levo)bupivacaine or ropivacaine for brachial plexus block prolonged analgesia from730 to 1306min. 13 There is controversy about the site of administration: Several authors claim that intravenous and perineural dexamethasone are equivalent in increasing PNB duration, 14-16, but the validity of this claim has been challenged. 17 Side effects include an increase in blood glucose levels. Dexmedetomidine: Dexmedetomidine has been studied as an adjuvant to mepivacaine, bupivacaine and ropivacaine, 8 prolonging the duration of analgesia in all studies. A recent study found no difference between intravenous and perineural dexmedetomidine 18 Side effects include hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. Magnesium: Magnesium has been studied as an adjuvant to prilocaine, (levo) bupivacaine 8 and ropivacaine, 19 prolonging the duration of analgesia in all studies. Side effects include an increased incidence of nausea. Perineural Catheters: A perineural catheter allows continuation of the PNB with continuous or intermittent administration of a local anaesthetic, hence increasing the duration of analgesia. Although this continuation is theoretically unlimited, most departments restrict postoperative perineural catheters to a maximum of three days. The benefits of perineural catheters are obvious: Prolonged optimal postoperative analgesia, reduced opioid consumption and its associated side effects, accelerating resumption of painfree passive joint range of motion and less sleep disturbance. Possible drawbacks of perineural catheters: - Procedure time is longer compared to a single shot PNB - Catheters may dislodge and fail - Risk of tachyphylaxis - Risk of infection - Risk of nerve damage Procedure time is longer, but also depends on proficiency. With increasing experience procedure time diminishes accordingly. Because PNB's, also single shot blocks, require time to take effect, it is preferable to place blocks not in the OR, but in a separate block room so that block procedure time does not interfere with the smooth flow of the OR list. When a block room is available, the longer procedure time of placing a perineural catheter is no longer an issue. Catheters may dislodge and fail, but that is not an exclusive feature of perineural catheters: single shot PNB's may fail as well. This is therefore not an argument in favour of single shot PNB and against PNB catheters. The efficacy of a PNB catheter may wear off over time due to tachyphylaxis. However, when using long-acting local anaesthetics such as ropivacaine or levobupivacaine this is seldom a clinical problem. A catheter passing the skin poses a risk for infection. Strict asepsis, sterile dressings, perioperative antibiotics and timely removal of the catheter are therefore mandatory to minimize this risk. 20 Data on the incidence of PNB catheter related infection are scarce. In our practice, we place approximately 1,500 PNB catheters annually; during the past 10 years, we have seen two infected catheters, both femoral. It seems therefore prudent to say that with adequate precautions, catheter-related infections are not a significant problem. One of the most feared complications of PNB is persisting nerve damage, a complication that applies to both single shot and continuous PNB. The issue of PNB-related postoperative nerve damage is clouded by the fact that surgery without PNB is also associated with postoperative nerve damage due to surgical trauma, tourniquet pressure and/or other factors, and it is often not possible to discern between the individual contribution of each of these possible causes to nerve damage. There are no prospective randomized studies that can answer the question if the incidence of nerve damage increases with the use of a perineural catheter, but it stands to reason that if direct neurotoxicity of the local anaesthetic is a causative factor, prolonged exposure would theoretically increase the risk. In a review addressing all aspects of continuous PNB, the combined incidence of nerve damage associated with continuous PNB (in various locations) persisting after nine months was calculated as 0.07%. 21 When deciding on the use a perineural catheter, benefits and risks have to be balanced for the individual patient. Especially patients with diabetic neuropathy are possibly more at risk for local anaesthetic induced nerve damage, 22 and it seems prudent to take this into account when deciding on the use of PNB, as well as the choice, dose and concentration of local anaesthetic. Discussion and Conclusions: When adding additives to local anaesthetics with the purpose of prolonging PNB/analgesia duration, it is important to realize that 1) none of the studied adjuvants is capable of extending the duration of analgesia beyond 24 hours, and 2) none of the adjuvants is approved for perineural administration, with the exception of epinephrine. Using these adjuvants is therefore off-label.

N2  - Introduction Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) may result in significant postoperative pain. Single injection interscalene blockade (ISB) has been used successfully to reduce postoperative pain after TSA(1). A limitation of single injection ISB is untimely block offset resulting in poorly controlled pain during nighttime hours. Clonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, is a frequently used local anesthetic adjuvant for the purpose of improving block duration and quality of analgesia. Results from past studies evaluating the role of clonidine in peripheral nerve blockade have shown conflicting analgesic outcomes (2-7), in many cases limited by small sample sizes. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the analgesic efficacy of perineural clonidine when added to ISB for TSA. Materials and methods (NA for case report) Following IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all consecutive patients who underwent TSA with an ultrasound guided single injection ISB for postoperative analgesia at our institution from January 2010 through November 2015. Any adult undergoing a TSA with preoperative ISB was eligible. After excluding patients with multiple blocks performed, the following data was recorded: baseline demographics, regional block technique, peri-operative medications, pain scores, 24 hour oral morphine equivalents(OME), time to first opioid administration after PACU dismissal, and peri-operative complications (intraoperative bradycardia [HR < 60], hypotension [percent of case with MAP < 60], stroke, ICU admission, or death). Results/Case report There were 1332 blocks performed without and 289 with perineural clonidine during the study period. There was no statistically significant difference in patient demographics (age, gender, ASA status, BMI), local anesthetic volume or peri-operative opioid administration between groups. Median clonidine dose was 100 mcg (mean 95 mcg). Pain scores are shown in Figure 1. There was a statistically significant decrease in pain (-0.39; 95% CI -0.13 to -0.64; p = 0.003) for the hours 3-7 after the block for the clonidine group. There was no difference (clonidine vs. none) in 24 hour OME (71.6±6.1 vs. 68.3±2.8 mg; p = 0.61) or time after surgery to first opioid administration (8.1±0.3h vs 8.0±0.2h; p=0.80). The clonidine group had more intraoperative hypotension (19.4±1.0% vs 17.3±0.4%, p =0.049), but no difference in vasopressor use. No other differences were observed in adverse effects including intraoperative bradycardia, unexpected ICU admission, stroke or death. Subgroup analysis controlling to one surgeon, fixed local anesthetic volume, and clonidine dose showed similar results. Discussion This retrospective study showed a statistical improvement in pain within the first 3-7 hours postoperatively; however, this difference was likely not clinically significant. Further, this did not translate into differences in opiate usage. This reflects past studies that show little to no improvement with clonidine (5). This review, while significantly larger in size than any prior study, suffers from the limitations of a retrospective study including the inability to control for all possible confounding factors or to record all measurements of interest including characterization of block quality. In summary, this study suggests only slight gains with the addition of clonidine; albeit without significant side effects.(Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), also known as neuralgic amyotrophy or brachial neuritis, is an uncommon condition characterized by acute onset of pain in the brachial plexus distribution followed by motor deficits that persist for weeks to months. Its pathophysiology is not well understood, but orthopedic surgery has been implicated as a possible trigger. We report a case of suspected PTS after total shoulder arthroplasty and interscalene brachial plexus blockade. Results/Case report A 70-year-old 64 kg, 178cm female presented to our facility for right shoulder total arthroplasty. Her medical history was remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and degenerative joint disease. A continuous interscalene nerve catheter was placed pre-operatively without incident. Prior to operating room transfer, the patient appropriately reported numbness and altered proprioception of her right arm and hand. The surgical procedure was completed without issue. On post-operative day 1, the patient was noted to have complete motor block and, following discontinuation of the local anesthetic infusion, significant motor and sensory deficits in the surgical extremity were revealed, including absent deep tendon reflexes and some areas of patchy hyperalgesia in all dermatomes of the right upper extremity. The patient had complete motor deficit in the right upper extremity and continued diminished, though slightly improved sensation in all dermatomes of the right upper extremity at the time of hospital discharge on post-operative day 4. At seven weeks post-operatively, the patient reported a new burning-sensation on the palmar surface of her hand and had continued biceps and triceps paralysis as well as radial and ulnar distribution paralysis. EMG performed was consistent with severe right brachial panplexopathy affecting the upper, motor, and lower trunks with ongoing motor denervation without signs of reinnervation. The patient began to show significant improvement six months post-operatively, demonstrating 4+/5 strength in her deltoid, biceps, and triceps. Sensation was intact in all distributions of her right upper extremity. Discussion The patient's acute and profound motor weakness, combined with panplexopathy on EMG, suggests that the patient had a pathophysiologic predisposition to nerve injury, which led to an inflammatory response and subsequent nerve injury during the perioperative period. Although the patient did not report any of these occurrences in the pre-operative period, PTS has been reported after bacterial or viral infection, immunizations, strenuous exercise, and psychological stress. Mechanical stretch injury and intraneural injection of local anesthetic were unlikely to be the direct causes of the patient's symptoms due to unremarkable events during the perioperative period. We present this medically challenging case as a rare presentation for a seemingly routine orthopedic procedure. Current literature suggests that the incidence of PTS may be higher than previously thought. Follow-up and reassurance becomes essential for anesthesiologists in these cases, as neuropathy can significantly decrease quality of life.

N2  - Reverse open shoulder arthroplasty requires a comprehensive analgesic plan involving regional anesthesia. The commonly performed interscalene brachial plexus blockade confers a high likelihood of diaphragmatic paralysis via phrenic nerve palsy, making this option riskier in patients with limited pulmonary reserve. Continuous blockade of the suprascapular nerve, a more distal branch of the C5 and C6 nerve roots, may be a viable alternative. We report a successful case of the use of a suprascapular nerve block with continuous programmed intermittent bolus perineural analgesia in a patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent reverse open shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - Little is known about the mid-term results of nonsurgical treatment for shoulder osteoarthritis (OA) especially in a Chinese population. This study sought to determine the efficacy of nonsurgical management in older patients with shoulder OA. A total of 129 conservatively treated unilateral shoulder OA patients who were older than 65 years were evaluated prospectively at the initial office visit and then subsequently at 3 6 12 18 24 and 36 months later. During the 36-month follow-up period all patients could receive conventional therapy such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication corticosteroid injection sodium hyaluronate and education at the discretion of treating physicians. Some patients received physiotherapy rehabilitation training and a shoulder strap to improve the range of motion and muscular strength training from a physical therapist. Parameters measured included comparative effectiveness of each therapeutic method visual analog scale (VAS) Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) scores. At 3-year follow-up most patients had a significant increase from their pretreatment values in pain self-assessed shoulder function mental health and 5 of 8 SF-36 domains. The study showed a decline in SST and VAS at 6 and 12 months after an initial ascent at 3 months and then it was rescued and continued at 3-year follow-up. Combined therapy could improve symptoms significantly. This study suggests that a conservative approach may be more appropriate and can produce satisfactory mid-term outcomes in selected cases. The findings of this study suggest that conservative treatments should be extended for longer than 12 months before the decision regarding shoulder arthroplasty is made.

N2  - The importance of mitigating pain in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty is extremely relevant for purposes of being able to initiate early functional rehabilitation and activities of daily living. The process, however, does not commence after surgery, but rather before surgery. Careful patient education and instruction, including preoperative exercises to maximize mobility, strength, and endurance within a limited range of motion is quite helpful. Intraoperatively, careful surgical technique providing adequate soft tissue releases, removal of potential pain generators such as the long tendon of the biceps and an arthritic acromia clavicular joint, contributes to decreasing postoperative pain. Adjunctive therapy includes preemptive ultrasound-guided intrascalene regional anesthesia, immediate postoperative peri-incisional injection of liposomalbupivicain, postoperative use of a waterproof dressing to allow warm showers early on in the rehabilitation period, perioperative use of COX-2 inhibitors, and a gentle, therapist-guided passive exercise program focusing on relaxation techniques. This in combination with early patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) pumps, transition to modest oral analgesics, on post op day 1 all add to the patient's parenteral narcotics in the first 24 ho, and oral narcotics within the first 7–10 days postoperatively.

N2  - Background: Recent literature has shown that Propionibacterium acnes can be cultured from superficial and deep layers of the shoulder. Our aims were to assess the rate of P. acnes colonization in patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty, to identify patient-related risk factors, and to evaluate the efficacy of our perioperative antisepsis protocol. Methods: Thirty consecutive patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty were included in our study. Swabs were taken perioperatively (4 superficial and 2 deep wound swabs) and analyzed quantitatively for P. acnes. Cefazolin minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for P. acnes isolates from positive deep cultures. Results: Twenty-two patients (73%) had positive cultures for P. acnes. Male gender (P = .024) and presence of hair (P = .005) had significantly higher rates of P. acnes superficial cultures. Subjects with positive superficial P. acnes cultures (P = .076) and presence of hair with a history of steroid injection (P = .092) were more likely to have deep P. acnes-positive cultures, but this was not statistically significant. Local topical antisepsis measures did not eradicate P. acnes (P = .12). Mean cefazolin minimum inhibitory concentration for P. acnes was 0.32 μg/mL. Conclusion: P. acnes is commonly isolated from the skin and deep surgical wounds of patients undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty who have not had previous shoulder surgery. Male gender and presence of hair were significant risk factors for P. acnes colonization. Perioperative local topical antisepsis and cefazolin administration were not effective in eliminating P. acnes colonization.

N2  - Objective. This study investigated interscalene block for shoulder arthroplasty with various ropivacaine concentrations in the presence of clonidine, dexamethasone, and buprenorphine. The goal was prolonged analgesia with minimal motor blockade. Design. Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting. University-affiliated orthopedic hospital. Methods. Patients (20/group) received acetaminophen, ketorolac, pregabalin, opioids, and “Control”; interscalene block, 0.375% ropivacaine, intravenous additives (buprenorphine, clonidine, dexamethasone); “High Dose”; 0.375% ropivacaine, perineural additives; “Medium Dose”; 0.2% ropivacaine, perineural additives; and “Low Dose”; 0.1% ropivacaine, perineural additives. Results. Pain with movement at 24 hours was 4.9±2.5 (mean6standard deviation [SD]) (Control), 4.5±3.0 (High Dose), 3.4±1.8 (Medium Dose), 4.2±2.4 (Low Dose). The difference between Medium Dose and Control was-1.5 (95% CI:-2.9,-0.1) (P50.040). Median time until need for opioids was 16.1 hours (Control) vs 23.7 hours (High Dose); hazard ratio 0.37 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.79]. High Dose had less pain with movement the morning after surgery, vs Control; 2.9±2.5 vs 4.9±2.7; P=0.027. Pain with movement in the Post- Anesthesia Care Unit was higher in Low Dose, vs Control; 0.9±1.4 vs 0±0, P=0.009. Low Dose had superior hand strength in the Post- Anesthesia Care Unit (mean±SD of pre-operative strength: 44.0± 20.3%) compared to Control (27.5±24.5%) (P=0.031). Conclusions. For maximum pain reduction, combining perineural additives with ropivacaine 0.375% or 0.2% is suggested. To minimize motor blockade, perineural additives can be combined with ropivacaine, 0.1%.

N2  - We present the unusual case of a 75-year-old man who presented in January 2013 with a non-tender, non-pruritic, erythematous nummular lesion on the right shoulder of 2 months duration. A 4 mm deep punch biopsy of the skin revealed diffuse interstitial inflltrate of inflammatory cells and a histological diagnosis of annular elastolytic granuloma was made. The patient was initially treated with topical steroids and steroid injections with a good response. Over a 2-year period, the lesion progressed in size and the patient started experiencing pain in the right shoulder. Ultrasound of the affected shoulder in February 2015 demonstrated a cystic lesion lying adjacent to the shoulder joint, and FNA biopsy of this showed an inflammatory process. Patch testing, syphilis, borreliosis and autoimmune screening were all negative. The lesion reduced in size following antibiotics taken postoperatively for prostate surgery, further raising suspicion for an infectious cause. An open biopsy of the right shoulder tissue was performed in July 2015. Tissue culture of the biopsy grew propionibacterium acnes in 5/5 samples. Microscopy revealed extensive granulation tissue and fibrosis with increased numbers of neutrophils present. These findings are consistent with a chronic low-grade infection, most likely caused by the patient's shoulder reconstruction several years earlier. The patient will undergo shoulder revision under the care of the orthopaedic specialist by implanting an antibiotic loaded cement spacer. It is well known that joint reconstructions can become infected with propionibacterium acnes. However, this is a unique case where the skin manifestation led to the diagnosis.

N2  - This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the effect of perineural with intravenous dexamethasone, both administered concomitantly with interscalene brachial plexus block for shoulder surgery. Patients received 8 mg dexamethasone mixed with ropivacaine in the block injection (n = 42), 8 mg dexamethasone intravenously at the time of the block (n = 37), or intravenous saline (n = 41) at the time of the block. Perineural and intravenous dexamethasone resulted in prolonged mean (SD) duration of block to 16.9 (5.2) h and 18.2 (6.4) h, respectively, compared with 13.8 (3.8) h for saline (p = 0.001). Mean (SD) opioid consumption (morphine equivalents) during the first 24 h after postanaesthesia recovery arrival was 12.2 (9.3) mg in the perineural dexamethasone, 17.1 (15.9) mg in the intravenous dexamethasone and 24.1 (14.3) mg in the saline groups (p = 0.001). Dexamethasone via either route reduced anti-emetic use (p = 0.046). There was no effect on patient satisfaction. These results suggest that both perineural and intravenous dexamethasone are useful adjuncts to ropivacaine interscalene block, with the intravenous route preferred as this avoids the possibility of neural toxicity of dexamethasone.

N2  - Background Cure rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved, but as therapy has intensified, the burden of osteonecrosis (ON) has increased. Limited data exist regarding surgical interventions for pediatric ALL patients with ON. Materials and Methods A multi-center cohort of children with newly diagnosed ALL was established with Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) data from 43 freestanding children's hospitals from 1999 to 2011. Patients with ON identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code were followed for up to 5 years after index ALL admission for the presence of ON-associated orthopedic surgical procedures. Results A cohort of 10,729 ALL patients was assembled, of which 242 (2.33%) were identified with an ICD-9 code for ON within 5 years of ALL diagnosis. Fifty-five patients (22.7%) with ON underwent orthopedic surgical intervention aimed at joint preservation (82%) or replacement (18%) with substantial practice variation by hospital in both the rate and type of surgical intervention. The majority of patients had surgical procedures while receiving maintenance therapy. None of the patients undergoing surgical intervention required intensive care unit-level care within 14 days of surgery, and there was no associated in-hospital mortality. Conclusions No standard of care exists for treatment of ALL-associated ON. While considerable practice variation exists, surgical intervention appears relatively safe.

N2  - Background: The goal of this study was to employ a national database to evaluate the association of preoperative injection before shoulder arthroscopy and arthroplasty with the incidence of postoperative infection. Methods: A national database of Medicare patients was queried for patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy or arthroplasty after ipsilateral shoulder injection. Three arthroscopy cohorts were created: arthroscopy within 3 months of injection (n = 3625), arthroscopy between 3 and 12 months after injection (n = 7069), and matched control arthroscopy without prior injection (n = 186,678). Three arthroplasty cohorts were created: arthroplasty within 3 months of injection (n = 636), arthroplasty between 3 and 12 months after injection (n = 1573), and matched control arthroplasty (n = 6211). Infection rates within 3 and 6 months postoperatively were assessed. Results: The incidence of infection after arthroscopy at 3 months (0.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.2; P < .0001) and 6 months (1.1%; OR, 1.6; P = .003) was significantly higher in patients who underwent injection within 3 months before arthroscopy compared with controls. The incidence of infection after arthroplasty at 3 months (3.0%; OR, 2.0; P = .007) and 6 months (4.6%; OR, 2.0; P = .001) was significantly higher in patients who underwent injection within 3 months before arthroplasty compared with controls. Conclusions: There was a significant increase in postoperative infection in Medicare patients who underwent injection within 3 months before shoulder arthroscopy and arthroplasty. This association was not noted when shoulder arthroscopy or arthroplasty occurred >3 months after injection.

N2  - Background: Osteonecrosis (ON) of the humeral head represents <5% of the shoulder arthroplasty population. Depending on the stage of disease, surgeons must decide between hemiarthroplasty (HA) and total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). To date, the peer-reviewed literature offers minimal insight into the best form of treatment of this population of patients. Methods: Between August 1973 and November 2010, 141 shoulder arthroplasties were performed for operatively confirmed ON of the humeral head; 67 HAs and 71 TSAs were observed for at least 2 years (mean, 9.3 years) or until reoperation. Indications for surgery included imaging-confirmed ON in a patient who had failed to respond to conservative treatment modalities. Results: Shoulder arthroplasty provided significant improvements in pain scores (P < .001), elevation (P < .01), and external rotation (P < .01) for both the HA and TSA populations. Both groups showed similar patient-reported satisfaction (>75%) and excellent/satisfactory Neer ratings (>65%). Eleven percent of HAs had moderate to severe glenoid erosion at follow-up, and 25% of glenoid components were radiographically at risk. Eight HAs and 11 TSAs underwent reoperation. The most common cause for reoperation was painful glenoid arthrosis in the HA group (7) and aseptic loosening (4) in the TSA group. The estimated 20-year survivorship of HA and TSA was 87% and 79%, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with atraumatic ON of the humeral head, both HA and TSA can be expected to provide lasting pain relief and improved range of motion, with HA having longer follow-up. HA should be strongly considered in patients with atraumatic ON of the humeral head and preserved glenoid cartilage.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence and the risk factors of surgical-site infection (SSI) and delayed wound healing (DWH) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent orthopedic surgery.Methods: We reviewed the records of 1036 elective orthopedic procedures undertaken in RA patients. Risk factors for SSI and DWH were assessed by logistic regression analysis using age, body mass index, disease duration, pre-operative laboratory data, surgical procedure, corticosteroid use, co-morbidity, and use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) as variables.Results: SSI and DWH were identified in 19 cases and 15 cases, respectively. One case of SSI and three cases of DWH were recorded among 196 procedures in patients using bDMARDs. Foot and ankle surgery was associated with an increased risk of SSI (odds ratio (OR), 3.167; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.256-7.986; p = 0.015). Total knee arthroplasty (TKA; OR, 4.044; 95% CI, 1.436-11.389; p = 0.008) and disease duration (OR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.000-1.007; p = 0.029) were associated with an increased risk of DWH.Conclusions: Our results indicated foot and ankle surgery, and TKA and disease duration as risk factors for SSI and DWH, respectively. bDMARDs was not associated with an increased risk of SSI and DWH.

N2  - Case: We describe the case of a ninety-year-old woman with a clavicular stress fracture that occurred ten months following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Conservative treatment was preferred by the patient, given her age and comorbidities. There was an important loss of function but a decrease in pain at four months after diagnosis. Conclusion: Clavicular stress fracture following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is rare, but shoulder surgeons should be aware of the possibility of this complication. The cause of stress fracture of the clavicle rather than the acromion remains unclear.

Material and methods: A 76-year-old man presented with episodes of agitation and confusion and was resuscitated with oral glucose gel when found to be hypoglycaemic. Results: A CT scan for an abdominal mass confirmed a solitary fibrous tumour (SFT). The sarcoma multidisciplinary team suggested conservative management. The patient's episodic hypoglycaemia was managed with diet modification including corn-based starch, scheduled snacks and dexamethasone. Glucose levels were within normal range at discharge from hospital. The patient was referred to the palliative care team for follow-up. Conclusion: SFTs causing non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia are difficult to treat.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Shoulder arthroplasty is associated with severe pain in the postoperative period. Regional analgesia, particularly interscalene brachial plexus blockade (ISB), may potentially reduce opioid consumption, adverse events, and hospital length of stay. However, there are notable risks with ISB including potential inadequate analgesia, sub-optimal shoulder mobility, and respiratory and neurological complications. An alternative pain control modality uses local infiltration with a single dose injection of liposomal bupivacaine. A multi-modal analgesic protocol utilizing liposomal bupivacaine could potentially provide sustained pain control in the postoperative period without the potential risks associated with ISB. The objective of the current study is to examine pain control efficacy in an initial set of patients who were treated with liposomal bupivacaine as the primary postoperative pain control method after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Methods: The study sample included 61 consecutive TSA and RSA cases in the time period between January 2013 and April 2015. There were 31 patients who were administered an ISB (ISB group) to control pain during the postoperative period and 30 patients who were given injections of liposomal bupivacaine (liposomal bupivacaine (20 cc) mixed with bupivacaine (30 cc), buffered with 30 cc saline) (LBUP group). The outcome measures were the average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (scale 0-10) collected 6 hours after surgery, at the end of postoperative day 1, at discharge, as well as the average hospital length of stay (LOS) and overall pain satisfaction (scale 0-4). The difference in demographics and outcomes between the treatment groups was tested using Student's t-tests and Chi-square tests. Multivariable regression analyses were also implemented to investigate associations between patient demographics, surgery, or treatment group with outcomes. Results: There were no significant differences in age (p=0.2546), BMI (p=0.3180), gender (p=0.5233), existing narcotic use (p=0.5102), side (p=0.5298), or procedure (p=0.3006) between ISB and LBUP groups. The LOS in the ISB group was 1.97 days compared to 1.67 days in the LBUP group (p=0.2767). Average VAS pain scores were as follows: at 6 hours after the procedure ISB = 3.7, LBUP=4.4 (p=0.3541); at 1 day postop ISB=4.8, LBUP=3.2 (p=0.0392); and at discharge ISB= 4.0, LBUP=3.2 (p=0.2401). Overall pain satisfaction was 3.2 in the ISB group and 3.5 in the LBUP group (p=0.0804). Regression analysis demonstrated that the pain was decreasing by date of surgery for the LBUP group at 6 hours (p=0.0333), on postoperative day 1 (p=0.0020) and at discharge (p=0.0038), indicating there were improved pain outcomes with increasing clinician experience with the treatment. Discussion: The current study found that TSA and RSA patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine had significantly less pain at the postoperative 1 day time point compared to patients treated with ISB. This pilot study showed promising results in the possibility for liposomal bupivacaine to reduce patient pain after TSA and RSA. Also, the data suggested that increased clinical experience with the treatment technique appeared to show greater improvement in pain-related outcomes. Modifications to the injection technique included using a longer needle to slow down the injection into deeper tissues, including a focus of infiltration around the suprascapular nerve, and modifying the technique to include three distinct injection times during the procedure. Additional studies will evaluate a larger sample of ISB and LBUP patients for pain, opioid use, and complications after shoulder arthroplasty. SIGNIFICANCE: This study evaluates the effectiveness of liposomal infiltration injections for pain control after shoulder arthroplasty. The successful use of local infiltration within multimodal pain control regimes may assist in reducing the reliance on opioid-based pain regimens after orthopedic surgery.

N2  - Objective: To describe an unusual cause of humeral head necrosis not mentioned until now in medical literature. Material and Methods: a 78 years old woman was referred with shoulder pain lasting several months without improvement with conservative measures. Her clinical history was irrelevant,. We decided to order a X-ray study which was consistent with a rotator cuff arthropathy (Fig. 1). She was suffering intense pain, so we decided to offer her a subacromial injection with corticosteroids. At the follow-up four weeks later, her clinical status become deteriorated with a worsening of pain control. New X-ray study was made and showed a massive destruction of humeral head (Fig. 2). Complementary studies were made in order to prove a septic or tumoral etiology that could explain the quickness of bone necrosis evolution. All studies were consistent with a humeral head necrosis without a clearly defined etiology. Results: in view of pathological changes (massive rotator cuff tear plus humeral head destruction) we performed an inverted shoulder arthroplasty. Microbiologic tests were negative and pathology examination showed only bone necrosis. Currently the patient shoulder remains painless and she is capable to do activities of daily leaving without limitations. Conclusion: humeral head necrosis is the second site most frequent of osteonecrosis. It is often associated with corticosteroids use, usually at high doses and over a long time period. The physiopathology is not well understood. It is believed that some changes of fat metabolism lead to ischemic events within the bone, mostly at subchondral level. The most relevant event of this case was that subacromial injection was the only risk factor that could be linked with this quick progression to bone necrosis, not mentioned before in medical literature.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this review is to summarise tear pattern classification and management options for massive rotator cuff tears (MRCT), as well as to propose a treatment paradigm for patients with a MRCT. Method: Data from 70 significant papers were reviewed in order to define the character of reparability and the possibility of alternative techniques in the management of MRCT. Results: Massive rotator cuff tears (MRCT) include a wide panoply of lesions in terms of tear pattern, functional impairment, and reparability. Pre-operative evaluation is critical to successful treatment. With the advancement of medical technology, arthroscopy has become a frequently used method of treatment, even in cases of pseudoparalytic shoulders. Tendon transfer is limited to young patients with an irreparable MRCT and loss of active rotation. Arthroplasty can be considered for the treatment of a MRCT with associated arthritis. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to establish an evidence-based treatment algorithm for MRCTs. Treatment is based on patient factors and associated pathology, and includes personal experience and data from case series.

N2  - Background: Shoulder replacement involves significant post-operative pain, which is often managed by continuous interscalene brachial plexus block. Catheter displacement and complications limit the beneficial effect of the block. Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) has provided good results in knee replacement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of LIA for pain after shoulder replacement. Methods: Patients scheduled for primary shoulder replacement under general anaesthesia were randomized to receive either local infiltration analgesia (LIA) (150 ml ropivacaine 0.2 % with epinephrine intra-operatively) or interscalene brachial plexus catheter (ISC) (ropivacaine 0.75 %, 7 ml bolus followed by 48-h 5 ml/h infusion). The primary outcome was opioid consumption during the first 24 post-operative hours. Secondary outcomes were pain ratings, supplementary analgesics, and side effects for 3 days, and complications until 3 months after surgery. Results: Data were analysed for 61 patients (LIA 30, ISC 31). Twenty-four-hour opioid consumption was higher in the LIA group compared with the ISC group: median (IQR) 95 mg (70–150 mg) versus 40 mg (8–76 mg) (P = 0.0001). No significant difference in opioid consumption was found between groups during the following 3 days. The LIA group had higher pain scores at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. Two patients in the ISC group had long-lasting complications. Conclusions: The LIA technique cannot be recommended for shoulder replacement unless substantially modified. Occurrence of inadequate analgesia and complications following interscalene brachial plexus block prompt further studies into pain management after shoulder replacement.

N2  - Purpose Bevacizumab, a monoclonal VEGF-A antibody, has been identified as an aetiology of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Long exposure to anti VEGF therapy induced chronic hypoperfusion of normal tissues. Osteonecrosis is a musculo-skeletal disease secondary to cellular death of bone component mainly induced by corticosteroids, alcohol use, or connective tissue disorders. Methods The medical records of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma receiving Bevacizumab between January 2006 and November 2013 were retrospectively reviewed and we had looked for osteonecrosis. Every disorder of musculoskeletal mobility were examined by orthopaedist and evaluated by imaging. Results We report on osteonecrosis of humeral and femoral head in patient with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma receiving a long-term exposure to anti angiogenic based treatment (>6 months), lack of other factors predisposing to osteonecrosis. These observations, according to literature, suggests that long exposure to anti VEGF-A, Bevacizumab, promote bone hypoperfusion and may induced osteonecrosis either on the femoral head or the humeral head with an incidence of 4 out of 1000 patients. Conclusions With an incidence of 4 out of 1000 patients osteonecrosis is a rare side effect of anti-angiogenic agent. With the increasing utilisation and duration of exposure of anti-VEGF therapy some rare side effect due to chronic ischemia may appear. The clinician should be aware about uncommon symptoms.

N2  - Introduction Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) can be associated with severe postoperative pain, especially in the first 48 hours after surgery. The use of interscalene brachial plexus provides superior pain control compared to systemic analgesia. Single injection interscalene blockade (SISB) provides adequate pain relief; however, no optimal dose has been identified and the duration of action is variable. Continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) provides extended analgesia compared to SISB, suggesting its use may be more appropriate for moderate-to-severe painful shoulder procedures. However, there is limited evidence that demonstrates the superiority of either technique specifically for TSA. Therefore, the objective of this retrospective observational study is to compare short-term analgesic and hospital outcomes in patients that received SISB versus CISB for primary TSA. Material and methods Patients aged ≥ 18 years that underwent first case elective primary TSA at Mayo Clinic from January 1, 2014 to September 15, 2014 were identified. Patients were separated into groups according to whether they received either SISB or CISB for postoperative pain control. All patients received general anesthesia for the operative procedure. Medical records were reviewed for pain scores (0=none, 10=worst) at 12 hours and 24 hours after block placement, intraoperative and postoperative opiate consumption (converted to oral morphine equivalents [OME]), and hospital stay. The primary outcome was defined as the median pain score 24 hours after block placement. Continuous variables were compared using the student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test when appropriate. Nominal variables were compared using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Two-tailed p-values ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 60 patients (SISB = 30, CISB = 30) were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in sex, age, ASA status, or preoperative opiate use between groups. There was no difference in the median pain score 12 hours after block placement (SISB=2 vs. CISB=1; p=0.982). However, the median pain score 24 hours after blockade was significantly higher in the SISB group compared to the CISB group (4.5 vs 3.5; p=0.021). Median opiate administration (mg OME) in the operating room (45 mg vs. 45 mg; p=0.699), PACU (0 vs. 0; p=0.120), and overall in the first 24 hours after block placement (50 mg vs. 27 mg; p=0.080) were not statistically different between SISB and CISB groups, respectively. The number of patients requiring more than one night of hospital stay was not statistically different (SISB 33.3% vs. CISB 23.3%; p=0.389). Discussion In this study, the median pain score 24 hours after SISB was statistically different than CISB. However, there were no statistical differences in opiate consumption, pain scores at other time points, or required length of stay beyond 1 night. Future prospective studies are necessary to clarify if the use of CISB is advantageous over SISB in short-term analgesic and hospital outcomes after TSA.

N2  - Introduction The U.S. patient population is aging at an unprecedented rate. The CDC predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will more than double by the year 2030 to over 71 million . Because an increasing portion of our population is now living longer, and the absolute number of older people is increasing, more surgeries are being performed on older patients than ever before. In 2007 patients over the age of 65 accounted for 43% of all inpatient hospital days and this number is likely to increase. Additionally, the normal physiology of aging is associated with alterations in pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. Older adults also have increased presence of co-morbidities and the combination of these factors ultimately leads to an increased risk of perioperative mortality . To reduce this risk, special care must be taken when developing an anesthetic plan for this patient population. Although convincing data has been hard to acquire showing reduced mortality associated with regional anesthesia, we remain optimistic that the selected use of regional anesthesia can provide good benefit when applied to the correct patient in the correct setting. With this background we present a case of successful pain management of a complex geriatric patient using a combined technique of multimodal analgesia and regional anesthesia for a right reverse total shoulder replacement and left proximal intermedullary nail for bilateral humerus fractures. Written informed consent for the procedures was obtained from the patient and the patient gave written consent to have the details of her case shared in this report. Our institution does not require IRB review of case reports. Material and methods Mrs. S is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, previous cerebral vascular accident, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen. She originally presented to the emergency department after a hot air balloon accident caused bilateral shoulder pain and she was subsequently found to have bilateral non-displaced humerus fractures. Initial management was non-surgical and the patient was placed in sling immobilization and scheduled for routine follow up with the orthopedic clinic. Prior to her orthopedic return visit she returned to the emergency department with altered mental status. The geriatric medicine service was consulted given her previously high level of function in the setting of acute delirium. Ultimately her AMS was thought to be multi-factorial with contributing factors including pain, recent opioid use, chronic electrolyte abnormalities and possible alcohol withdrawal. After several days her delirium resolved and the patient was discharged home on a simplified medical regimen. On return to the orthopedic clinic, the patient was now found to have significantly displaced bilateral humerus fractures and she was scheduled for surgical repair. Staged procedures were recommended to the patient but she refused. She was seen the same day in our pre-anesthetic evaluation clinic and evaluated and consented for both regional and general anesthesia. Given the patient's recent delirium and geriatric medicine's recommendations to minimize opioids, as well as her history of COPD, we elected to place bilateral ultrasound guided single shot suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks using 0.5% ropivicaine in addition to dexamethasone and clonidine as adjuvants. She tolerated the procedure well. She underwent a general anesthetic and received a total of 100 mcg of fentanyl. Operative repair was completed without intraoperative complication. She was able to participate in physical and occupational therapy and was weaned to oral analgesics on postoperative day one. She was discharged home on postoperative day four. Results see discussion Discussion Mrs. S. presented several challenges to optimal anesthetic management. In addition to her increased perioperative mortality risk due to her multiple co-morbidities, she was also at a significantly increased risk of postoperative delirium given her age and recent admission for altered mental status . Delirium is not only a distressing event, it is also associated with poor functional recovery after joint replacement, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased length of hospital stay . Furthermore, there is some suggestion that both uncontrolled pain and the use of opioids in the postoperative period increase the incidence of delirium . For these reasons, we felt that Mrs. S. was an ideal candidate for regional analgesia. Traditionally, the interscalene nerve block of the brachial plexus at C5, C6, and C7 has been used to manage perioperative analgesia for surgeries of the shoulder. However, interscalene blocks have a reported 100% incidence of phrenic nerve palsy, which eliminated bilateral interscalene blocks from consideration . In fact, unilateral phrenic nerve palsy can cause respiratory complications in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease . Instead of performing the more traditional interscalene approach to the brachial plexus, we achieved analgesia by individually blocking the nerves that provide sensation to the shoulders via bilateral single shot suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks. Shoulder analgesia is principally achieved with blockade of the suprascapular and axillary nerves; however, there is minor contributory innervation to the shoulder by the subscapular, lateral pectoral and musculocutaneous nerves. Using ultrasound guidance with a high frequency linear probe we identified the suprascupular notch. The long axis of the probe was placed in the coronal plane over the lateral scapula. Color Doppler was utilized to identify the suprascapular artery. While maintaining continuous visualization of the needle in the long axis an 18-gauge touhey needle was inserted from medial to lateral. 10 cc of injectate was deposited within the suprascapular notch. We attempted to identify the circumflex artery for blockade of the axillary nerve but were unsuccessful because of significant pain associated with positioning. Thus, using the ultrasound we followed the periosteum of the proximal humerus cephelad until it met the joint capsule. We then infiltrated 10 cc of injectate 1 cm caudal to this point. In summary, we used the combination of bilateral suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks to achieve adequate postoperative analgesia in an elderly medically complex patient with a recent history of altered mental status and a relative contraindication to interscalene brachial plexus block. We hope that it will provide others an example of the application of regional anesthesia to better achieve perioperative anesthetic goals.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this work is to investigate in a quantitative manner, the gross and regional structural patterns in cartilage and bone from the humeral head of end-stage OA patients, with the goal of identifying patterns of disease. Since the prevalence of primary OA of the shoulder is increasing as the population ages and the non-traumatic degenerative changes leading to this disease are poorly understood, a site-specific morphometric analysis speaks to the structure-function remodelling relationship of the pathological anatomy. Methods: Humeral heads were harvested from twenty-one patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for end-stage primary OA. The samples were scanned with micro-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and registered to provide reconstructed 3D datasets of the cartilage, cortical and trabecular bone tissues. Gross visual examination of the datasets allowed samples to be classified as OA-like, osteoporosis (OP)-like or OA/OP-like. Results: Volumes of interest (VOI) separating the OA-like samples into five distinct regions showed positive correlations between bone and cartilage morphometric parameters; specifically in areas where more cartilage has been lost, the underlying subchondral cortical bone was more porous and thicker, while the subchondral trabecular bone was more dense, including more connections and trabeculae. These differences were site-specific, where the central humeral head saw the greatest destruction of cartilage and bone sclerosis, followed by the anterior aspects. Conclusion: The ability to correlate bone and cartilage changes is valuable, as these structural cues may allow a more targeted diagnostic approach and a better classification of the disease, leading to improved therapies.

N2  - Management of massive irreparable rotator cuff tears can be challenging. In patients who are not candidates for shoulder arthroplasty, either because of age or higher levels of activity, tendon transfers remain a good surgical option to reconstruct the deficient rotator cuff. The latissimus dorsi is the most commonly described tendon transfer for posterior-superior rotator cuff deficiency. Additional options include teres major and lower trapezius transfers. For anterior-superior irreparable rotator cuff tears, the pectoralis major transfer, whether superficial or deep to the conjoined tendon, is the most commonly described transfer. Additional transfers include those of pectoralis minor, teres major, and latissimus dorsi. The purpose of this article is to provide an evidence-based overview of the different types of tendon transfers that have been described to reconstruct massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears.

N2  - The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has recently developed several clinical practice guidelines (CPG) involving upper extremity conditions. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the practice patterns of members of the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) with regard to the CPGs. An e-mail survey was sent to the 340 members of the ASES. The survey contained 40 questions involving the subject matter of the 2 existing AAOS CPGs pertaining specifically to the shoulder: Optimizing the Management of Rotator Cuff Problems and the Treatment of Glenohumeral Joint Arthritis. Overall, 98 responses were obtained, for a response rate of 29%. Only 19 of 47 CPGs were not "inconclusive" and a recommendation was actually made. A majority (more than 50%) of surgeons agreed with 17 (90%) of 19 of these AAOS recommendations. A strong majority (more than 80%) adhered to 13 (68%) of 19 recommendations. There were 4 consensus recommendations, and more than 50% agreed with all of them. Of the 5 moderate recommendations, more than 50% agreed with 4 of them. There were 10 weak recommendations, and more than 50% of surgeons agreed with 9 of them. There was more than 80% agreement on 18 of 28 inconclusive recommendations. Although the AAOS CPGs are not meant to be fixed protocols, they are intended to unify treatment and/or diagnosis of common problems based on the best evidence available. Despite the majority of the AAOS CPG recommendations for rotator cuff problems and glenohumeral arthritis being inconclusive, most surgeons agree with most of the CPG recommendations.

N2  - Hypothesis: Distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is an under-reported complication after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic RCR by 4 shoulder surgeons during a 2-year period. The primary outcome measure was the diagnosis of DPN, defined as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, ulnar tunnel syndrome, and distal radial sensory neuropathy. Patient demographics and clinical course of DPN were recorded. Mean follow-up was 21, 15, and 12months for TSA, RSA, and RCR, respectively. Results: Postoperatively, 6 of 85 TSA (7.1%), 7 of 57 RSA (12.3%), and 21 of 753 RCR (2.79%) patients were diagnosed with DPN. The most common neuropathy was cubital tunnel syndrome for TSA and RSA and carpal tunnel syndrome for RCR. The risk of DPN was higher for shoulder arthroplasty (TSA and RSA) compared with the RCR group. After nonsurgical treatment of DPN, complete resolution of symptoms occurred in 33.3% of TSA, 42.86% of RSA, and 71.43% of RCR patients. However, 16.7% of TSA, 14.3% of RSA, and 4.76% of RCR patients with DPN required surgical decompression; 100% of the patients undergoing surgical decompression had complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusion: DPN is a relatively common complication after shoulder surgery. When it occurs, DPN will often resolve with nonoperative management. Surgical decompression is an effective treatment option in refractory cases.

The purpose of this article is to review the biomechanical properties of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral joint and the pathophysiology, imaging characteristics, and treatment options of rotator cuff tear arthropathy (RCTA). CONCLUSION. Although multiple pathways have been proposed as causes of RCTA, the exact cause remains unclear. Increasing knowledge about the clinical diagnosis, imaging features, and indicators of severity improves recognition and treatment of this pathologic condition.

N2  - Background: Propionibacterium acnes has arisen as the most common microorganism identified at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty. There is limited evidence to suggest how frequently false-positive cultures occur. The purpose of this prospective controlled study was to evaluate culture growth from specimens obtained during open shoulder surgery. Methods: Patients undergoing an open deltopectoral approach to the shoulder were prospectively enrolled. Patients with a history of shoulder surgery or any concern for active or previous shoulder infection were excluded. Three pericapsular soft-tissue samples were taken from the shoulder for bacterial culture and were incubated for fourteen days. A sterile sponge was also analyzed in parallel with the tissue cultures. In addition, similar cultures were obtained from patients who had undergone previous shoulder surgery. Results: Overall, 20.5% of surgeries (twenty-four of 117) yielded at least one specimen removed for culture that was positive for bacterial growth, and 13.0% of sterile control specimens (seven of fifty-four) had positive culture growth (p = 0.234). P. acnes represented 83.0% of all positive cultures (thirty-nine of forty-seven) at a median incubation time of fourteen days. Among the subjects who had not undergone previous surgery, 17.1% (fourteen of eighty-two) had at least one positive P. acnes culture. Male sex was univariably associated with a greater likelihood of bacterial growth (p < 0.01), and patients who had not undergone previous surgery and had received two or more preoperative corticosteroid injections had a higher likelihood of bacterial growth (p = 0.047). Conclusions: The clinical importance of positive P. acnes cultures from specimens obtained from open shoulder surgery remains uncertain. Male sex and preoperative corticosteroid injections were associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial growth on culture and are risk factors that merit further investigation. Previously reported incidences of positive P. acnes culture results from specimens from primary and revision shoulder arthroplasty may be overestimated because of a substantial level of culture contamination. Clinical Relevance: P. acnes is isolated via culture at a substantial rate from shoulders undergoing a deltopectoral approach. The clinical importance of culture growth by this low-virulence organism still remains uncertain. Further study is necessary to more specifically characterize culture growth by P. acnes as an infection, commensal presence, or contaminant.

N2  - Anatomic total shoulder and reverse total shoulder arthroplasties are excellent treatment options for various glenohumeral joint pathologies. Specific shoulder conditions require a tailored approach with each presenting unique technical challenges. Although infrequent, complications in shoulder arthroplasty can be complex to manage and the cause of significant patient morbidity. The presented cases provide a brief overview of the diagnostic dilemmas and treatment options for common and uncommon disorders encountered in shoulder arthroplasty.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural history of rheumatoid disease of the shoulder over an eight-year period. Our hypothesis was that progression of the disease is associated with a decrease in function with time. A total of 22 patients (44 shoulders; 17 women, 5 men, (mean age 63)) with rheumatoid arthritis were followed for eight years. All shoulders were assessed using the Constant score, anteroposterior radiographs (Larsen score, Upward-Migration-Index (UMI)) and ultrasound (US). At final follow-up, the Short Form-36, disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) Score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and use of anti-rheumatic medication were determined. The mean Constant score was 72 points (50 to 88) at baseline and 69 points (25 to 100) at final follow-up. Radiological evaluation showed progressive destruction of the peri-articular structures with time. This progression of joint and rotator cuff destruction was significantly associated with the Constant score. However, at baseline only the extent of rotator cuff disease and the UMI could predict the Constant score at final follow-up. A plain anteroposterior radiograph of the shoulder is sufficient to assess any progression of rheumatoid disease and to predict functional outcome in the long term by using the UMI as an indicator of rotator cuff degeneration.

N2  - Purpose: Conservative treatments are especially in patients with GHOA important, since shoulder arthroplasty has its limitations. In this systematic review we will evaluate the current evidence regarding the efficacy of intra-articular infiltration treatment options in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GH-OA). Methods: The following databases are searched: Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Clinical Trial Register, Embase and the WHO clinical trial register. All intra-articular injection products used for the treatment of shoulder OA in humans are included. Results: A total of 8 studies could be included in this review. Hyaluronic acid (HA) showed effect sizes of 2.07, 2.02 and 2.11 at 6,12 and 26 weeks follow-up, respectively. Placebo (1.60 , 1.82 and 1.68) also showed stable effect sizes at the same time points. The efficacy of corticosteroids (CS) decreased rapidly at follow-up (1.08, 0.43 and 0.19). Although statistical significant, the maximum difference in effect sizes between HA and placebo was only 0.43 with absolute values between 2.0 and 6.4 on a 100-point VAS for pain. Conclusion: Intra-articular treatment with HA has a good efficacy at follow-up compared to baseline. However, the difference in efficacy between HA and placebo never reaches the minimal clinically important difference at any of the follow-up points. We are not able to give clear recommendations for the use of intra-articular CS injections in patients with GH-OA. In future research we recommend to focus on sufficiently powered randomized trials to compare the efficacies of HA, CS, placebo and other intra-articular treatment options in patients with GH-OA.

N2  - Open resection arthroplasty of the sternoclavicular (SC) joint has historically provided good long-term results in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the SC joint. However, the procedure is rarely performed because of the risk of injury to vital mediastinal structures and concern regarding postoperative joint instability. Arthroscopic decompression of the SC joint has therefore emerged as a potential treatment option because of many recognized advantages including minimal tissue dissection, maintenance of joint stability, avoidance of posterior SC joint dissection, expeditious recovery, and improved cosmesis. There are, however, safety concerns given the proximity of neurovascular structures. In this article we demonstrate a technique for arthroscopic SC joint resection arthroplasty in a 26-year-old active man with bilateral, painful, idiopathic degenerative SC joint osteoarthritis. This case also highlights the pearls and pitfalls of arthroscopic resection arthroplasty for the SC joint. There were no perioperative complications. Four months postoperatively, the patient had returned to full activities, including weightlifting, without pain or evidence of SC joint instability. One year postoperatively, the patient showed substantial improvements in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score; Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and Short Form 12 Physical Component Summary score over preoperative baseline values. © 2014 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

N2  - Cuff tear arthropathy is the arthritic eroded collapse of the glenohumeral joint with progressive superior humeral migration in the setting of long-standing rotator cuff insufficiency. The ideal management of cuff tear arthropathy remains elusive. Current arthroplasty options include hemiarthroplasty or reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Proper clinical and radiographic evaluation is essential in decision making in order to optimize outcomes. Acromio-humeral distance (AHD), as measured on plain radiographs, as well as fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff muscles on MRI are reliable tools for decision making. AHD < 7. mm correlates well with complete tear of the supraspinatus while AHD < 5. mm indicates infraspinatus involvement with significant muscular atrophy. Hemiarthroplasty remains an option for providing pain relief; however, continued development of superior migration and glenoid erosion remains a concern. The conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty after hemiarthroplasty can be difficult due to glenoid bone loss. Recent literature supports the use of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty for cuff tear arthropathy with significant differences in functional outcome. Here, we discuss the radiographic evaluation of cuff tear arthropathy and review the treatment options and why we advocate the use of the reverse prosthesis. © 2014.

N2  - We describe a case of shoulder hemiarthroplasty infection with Desulfovibrio legallii. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of 36 Desulfovibrio isolates are presented. Metronidazole and carbapenems exhibited reliable activity, although piperacillin-tazobactam did not. Eleven previous cases of Desulfovibrio infection are reviewed; most arose from a gastrointestinal tract-related source. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - We report an 89-year-old woman with bilateral atraumatic scapular spine fracture several months after bilateral reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Recently, RTSA has gained popularity in the surgical treatment of complex shoulder disorders such as cuff tear arthropathy. However, scapular fractures may occur several months after surgery as a late complication of this procedure. In this case report we focus on a relatively uncommon subtype, the scapular spine fracture. Although well-known in the orthopedic literature, radiologists are less familiar with this complication. To the best of our knowledge, bilateral scapular fractures have not yet been reported. © 2013 ISS.

N2  - Background: Deep infection is a debilitating complication after shoulder arthroplasty. Intra-articular injection of antibiotic can give a higher concentration compared with intravenous administration. We hypothesized that a group of patients given an intra-articular, intraoperative injection of gentamicin would report a lower infection rate than a group without local antibiotics. Methods: Between 2005 and 2011, the senior author performed 507 shoulder arthroplasties. We retrospectively reviewed all of those cases. All patients were administered systemic prophylactic antibiotics. Beginning in June 2007, patients were also injected with 160 mg of gentamicin in the glenohumeral joint at the end of their surgery. Patient records were examined for preexisting medical conditions, type of surgery, and presence of infection. Patients receiving surgery before 2007 were compared with those after to determine the effect of prophylactic gentamicin administration in preventing deep infection associated with surgery. All patients were observed for a minimum of 1 year. Results: Of the 507 surgeries, 164 were performed before 2007 (without intra-articular injection ofgentamicin; group A) and 343 were performed with addition of gentamicin (group B). In groupA, 5 patients presented with infection (3.0%) compared with 1 in group B (0.29%). The gender,mean age, mean body mass index, and prevalence of comorbidities were similar between the groups. Conclusions: The data from this study support the conclusion that intra-articular intraoperative gentamicin administration may reduce postoperative infection. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Background Efficacy and safety of alirocumab were compared with ezetimibe in hypercholesterolemic patients at moderate cardiovascular risk not receiving statins or other lipid-lowering therapy. Methods In a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study (NCT01644474), patients (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] 100-190 mg/dL, 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular events ≥ 1%-<5% [systemic coronary risk estimation]) were randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n = 51) or alirocumab 75 mg subcutaneously (via 1-mL autoinjector) every 2 weeks (Q2W) (n = 52), with dose up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W (also 1 mL) at week 12 if week 8 LDL-C was ≥ 70 mg/dL. Primary endpoint was mean LDL-C % change from baseline to 24 weeks, analyzed using all available data (intent-to-treat approach, ITT). Analyses using on-treatment LDL-C values were also conducted. Results Mean (SD) baseline LDL-C levels were 141.1 (27.1) mg/dL (alirocumab) and 138.3 (24.5) mg/dL (ezetimibe). The 24-week treatment period was completed by 85% of alirocumab and 86% of ezetimibe patients. Least squares mean (SE) LDL-C reductions were 47 (3)% with alirocumab versus 16 (3)% with ezetimibe (ITT; p < 0.0001) and 54 (2)% versus 17 (2)% (on-treatment; p < 0.0001). At week 12, before up-titration, alirocumab 75 mg Q2W reduced LDL-C by 53 (2)% (on-treatment). Injection site reactions were infrequent (< 2% and < 4% of alirocumab and ezetimibe patients, respectively). Conclusions Alirocumab demonstrated significantly greater LDL-C lowering versus ezetimibe after 24 weeks with the lower 75 mg Q2W dose sufficient to provide ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction in the majority of the patients. Adverse events were comparable between groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Arthritis of the glenohumeral joint is a common cause of debilitating shoulder pain, affecting up to one-third of patients older than 60 years. It is progressive in nature and characterized by irreversible destruction of the humeral head and glenoid articular surfaces. Inflammation of the surrounding soft tissues is often present and further contributes to the pain caused by the disease process.A number of primary (degenerative) and secondary pathological processes may result in this condition. Patients often present with a long history of shoulder pain, stiffness, and/or loss of function, or may have acute exacerbations of this chronic condition. Initial conservative management is aimed at improving pain and restoring function. Surgical treatment is indicated in severe or refractory cases when nonoperative management has failed. Shoulder replacement now accounts for the third most common joint replacement surgery after the hip and knee. This article reviews the basic science and clinical management of osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint.

N2  - Purpose: The diagnostic and therapeutic success of shoulder joint injection depends on its accuracy.Two recent studies reported high success (93-96%) for non-imaging-assisted anterior injection in anes-thetized patients. This study examined the accuracy of anterior shoulder injection in awake patientsunder conditions similar to the office setting.Methods: The study group consisted of 166 consecutive patients with shoulder pain who underwentdiagnostic magnetic resonance arthrography at a tertiary medical center in 2011-2012. As part of theexamination, contrast material was injected into the glenohumeral joint via an anterior approach bya certified musculoskeletal radiologist without any image assistance. Success was defined as contrastmaterial limited to the intra-articular joint on the scan, without scatter to the periauricular tissue.Results: A successful injection was verified by magnetic resonance arthography in 163 patients (98.2%).Conclusions: Non-assisted anterior shoulder injection is highly accurate (98.2%) in the hands of an expe-rienced radiologist, even in awake patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Rheumatic diseases are multisystem conditions that predominantly affect the musculoskeletal system, leading to soft tissue and articular damage. Historically, medical therapy was able to slow, but not prevent, erosion and joint destruction, resulting in the frequent need for orthopedic procedures to maintain function and minimize pain. However, the widespread use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic therapy over the last twenty years has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the incidence of musculoskeletal damage and impairment among these patients. This review will discuss changing patterns of orthopedic surgery among patients with rheumatic diseases, focusing on rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by apical ballooning of the left ventricle. This has been described in the cardiac literature, however, there is a paucity of information related to the incidence of this syndrome following heart transplantation. We describe a patient who developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 6 years after an orthotopic heart transplant. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69 year old male who had undergone an orthotopic heart transplant 6 years prior presented with sudden respiratory distress and hypotension 30 minutes after a total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient was intubated and chest imaging was consistent with pulmonary edema and lower lobe consolidation. The patient was started on antibiotics given the possibility of sepsis in the setting of aspiration pneumonia. Intravenous methylprednisolone was started and Tacrolimus levels were maintained within a therapeutic range. Hemodynamic monitoring demonstrated a cardiac index of 1.77 L/min/m2. Transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate global hypokinesis most pronounced from the mid to distal left ventricle suggestive of an apical ballooning syndrome and an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. Endomyocardial biopsy did not show acute cellular rejection and a coronary angiogram revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. At this point, a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made and inotropic support with milrinone was started. The patient subsequently improved and follow up echocardiogram 10 days after showed an improved EF of 65%. The patient recuperated without further incident. DISCUSSION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically occurs in the setting of severe emotional or physical stressors and is common among postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology centers around excessive sympathetic nervous system activation resulting in high circulating catecholamine levels in turn causing myocardial stunning. In heart transplant patients, parasympathetic denervation theoretically leads to an exaggerated response to catecholamines and may increase susceptibility to stress induced cardiomyopathy. Given the rarity of this condition, other more common differential diagnoses should also be considered such as transplant rejection and coronary ischemia. The subsequent improvement of the patient's cardiac function attests to the reversible nature of this condition. CONCLUSIONS: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may occur in heart transplant recipients but is a rarely reported entity. This condition should be considered in the event of an unexplained sudden decline in cardiac function in this population.

N2  - Case Description: A 46-year-old man with a history of Huntington's chorea and dislocated right total shoulder replacement presented with chronic right shoulder pain and severely limited range of motion for 6 months. Physical examination was significant for right shoulder held in fixed adduction and elevation. The trapezius, infraspinatus, teres minor, supraspinatus, and rotator cuff insertion was tender to palpation. There was essentially no active range of motion of the shoulder, and passive range of motion caused significant pain. There were skin changes of the axilla from poor hygiene. The patient failed conservative management with Tramadol Hcl, trigger point injections, and Botulinum Toxin injections. Opiate medications were avoided due to cognitive side effects and risk of fall. Finally, radiofrequency ablation of the right suprascapular and axillary nerve was performed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. Setting: Tertiary care hospital Results or Clinical Course: There was 75% improvement in pain and mobility of the hand immediately following radiofrequency ablation. 3 months later, he had 80% improvement in shoulder pain, with significantly better sleep and increased range of motion allowing cleansing of the axilla. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case utilizing radiofrequency ablation for chronic shoulder pain in the setting of dislocated total shoulder replacement in a patient with Huntington's chorea. Conclusions: Radiofrequency ablation is a safe and effective method of pain management when used with fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance for shoulder pain in the setting of Huntington's chorea and dislocated total shoulder replacement.

N2  - Introduction: The goal of ambulatory continuous regional analgesia (ACRA) is to provide postoperative pain control lasting for 48-72 hours and to discharge home patients who would otherwise have to be admitted to the hospital for pain control. ACRA is useful for especially painful procedures and allows shortening patients' length of stay, limiting sleep disturbances and the side effects of opioids, and improving patient satisfaction. In a study of postoperative pain among ambulatory patients, “The orthopedic patients had the highest incidence of severe pain” and “Shoulder surgery was the most painful orthopedic procedure” (Chung et al. Anesth Analg 1997). Those patients will especially benefit from ACRA. Single-injection blocks have a long track record and their postoperative management is well codified. CRA is a relatively new technique and is still evolving. CRA, when successful, allows avoiding the analgesic gap, the onset of severe pain when the block wears off. However, it is not free of concerns such as failure, toxicity, excessive motor block, possible falls for lower extremity blocks, and excessive sensory block leading to unrecognized surgical complications such as compartment syndrome. Cost and time are also a concern. A minority of patients complains of the resulting insensate (“dead”) extremity, and occasionally comments that they prefer having pain to the unpleasant paresthesias caused by the continuous block, but these are a minority. Neurologic injury does not seem to be more common with continuous than with single-injection techniques. Bergman BD et al. (Anesth Analg 2003): 405 axillary catheters, 2 anesthesia-related neurologic deficits (0.5%); Borgeat A. et al. (Anesth Analg 2006): 1001 popliteal catheters, no neuropathy or infection; Compère V et al. (Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 2009): 400 popliteal catheters, 2 neuropathies (0.5%). Catheter colonization is common, but infection is rare. Cuvillon P et al. (Anesth Analg 2001): 208 CFNB for 48 hours, 57% colonization, no cellulitis/abscess, 3 bacteremias. However, infection can be catastrophic: Maheshwari A et al. (Anesthesiology 2013) describe a multiloculated abscess of the thigh following a popliteal catheter left in place 4 days after a trimalleolar fracture ORIF. In practice: One published example of practical experience is Swanson's article (Anesth Analg 2006), describing 620 ambulatory patients who received ultrasound (US)-guided catheters. Exclusion criteria included morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic opioid use, and severe cardiopulmonary disease. Among the blocks, 190 were interscalene (ISB), 206 femoral, and 224 popliteal blocks. The author reports 2 complications (popliteal) with one case of weakness and sensory loss that resolved within 6 weeks, and one case of CRPS that resolved after 3 sympathetic blocks within 6 weeks. The intervention rate for troubleshooting was 26/620 = 4.2%. Out of these, 9 were patient education issues, 4 were due to equipment malfunction, and 13 to inadequate pain control. Patients with inadequate pain control wee treated with a LA bolus in 7 cases. Fluid was accumulating around the catheter site in 3 patients, leading to a dressing change in 1 patient. One patient was unable to remove the catheter. There were 5 cases of the catheter being dislodged; 3 returned for a repeat block, while 1 was readmitted and started on an IV PCA. Commonly used ambulatory perineural/plexus blocks are as follows: - ISB for e.g. total shoulder arthroplasty, arthroscopy with acromioplasty, rotator cuff repair. - Supraclavicular block, infraclavicular block for e.g. elbow replacement, elbow release, wrist fusion, or carpectomy. - Axillary block for e.g. wrist fusion, first row carpectomy - Psoas compartment block for hip surgery (e.g. arthroscopy) [rarely used block for ambulatory patients] - Femoral block / FICB / adductor canal block for e.g. ACL/PCL reconstruction. - Sciatic block at the buttock/thigh (multiple techniques), popliteal block for e.g. major foot/ankle surgery. Patient selection is paramount for success. Typically, only ASA 1, 2, and carefully selected 3 patients are candidates. Patients should live close enough to return in case of a problem. Patients with cognitive dysfunction, drug abuse, or psychiatric disorder should be excluded. A language barrier is also an exclusion criterion, as troubleshooting would be impossible over the phone. Significant hepatic/renal impairment (possibly increasing the risk of local anesthetic (LA) systemic toxicity), and respiratory impairment for ISB, must lead to carefully weighing risks and benefits. A caretaker should be available at home at least for the first night, and if possible for the full duration of the infusion, to monitor the patient, and to remove the catheter if needed. One major difference with inpatient catheters is that, in case of secondary catheter failure, the patient will not be easily accessible for troubleshooting or to repeat the block. It is therefore extremely important to ensure correct catheter placement to avoid secondary failure, and there are three main options. 1. One can inject the loading dose of LA through the catheter instead of through the needle. This will ensure, in case of successful block, that the catheter is in correct position. However, there is a risk that no block will result if the catheter is misplaced. 2. A stimulating catheter can be used. This will allow verifying positioning near the nerve or plexus initially, but also later on once the block has subsided. My experience with stimulating catheters has been somewhat mixed, however. 3. The best option is to use ultrasound (US) to confirm catheter position. This can be done by injecting local anesthetic and visualizing the spread, or using color Doppler to visualize the turbulence caused by the injection. A few mL of air can also be injected and will be clearly seen as a hyperechoic image. Of note, US-guided single-injection blocks appear to be similar to neurostimulation (NS) in terms of failure rates (Liu S et al. Anesth Analg 2009). However, perineural catheters placed with US-guidance are more effective than NS, and necessitate fewer needle passes with less patient discomfort (Fredrickson M et al. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2009).

N2  - A 73 y/o woman was scheduled for total shoulder arthroplasty. Her past medical history was significant for obesity, severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease requiring home oxygen, biochemically active metastatic rectal carcinoid syndrome, peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, and severe degenerative osteoarthritis of the left shoulder with severely restricted motion. The patient had also been on multiple medications for chronic arthritic and neuropathic pain. There was concern that managing the patient's pain with a regional block placed at the interscalene level could compromise the patient's lung function and result in respiratory distress even with volumes as low as 5 ml.1 There was also concern that avoiding regional anesthesia altogether and controlling her pain using systemic medications only could also pose a problem given her chronic opioid use and her obstructive sleep apnea. The anesthesia team decided that the best approach would be a regional anesthesia technique that could be used for intraoperative and postoperative pain control but could reliably avoid involvement of the phrenic nerve. Using a 80 mm 22 G echogenic stimulating needle with ultrasound guidance, the posterior cord of the brachial plexus was identified by visualization and confirmed by stimulation resulting in deltoid muscle movement using a transverse infraclavicular approach.2 8 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine with dexamethasone was injected into the area around the posterior cord and good spread around the posterior cord was noted. After this injection was completed the patient was placed in a seated position, and a suprascapular nerve block was placed under ultrasound guidance at the level of the spine of the scapula using 12 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine with dexamethasone.3 (Figure presented) The patient was again placed supine, and immediately said that she had no pain in her shoulder for the first time in many years. Pulmonary ultrasound did not demonstrate paralysis of hemidiaphragm. She proceeded to the operating room and was placed under general anesthesia for her comfort. An arterial line was placed given the patient's history of carcinoid. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no reaction to incision and no exacerbation of her carcinoid symptoms. The patient was extubated uneventfully at the end of the operation and had good pain control. The local anesthetic provided pain relief for approximately 18 hours and she was able to be transitioned onto oral agents without difficulty. The patient was discharged from the hospital on POD #2 with no complications. Follow up has been uneventful.

N2  - Transient Phrenic Nerve Paresis (TPNP) occurs with an incidence of 13-100% after interscalene block (ISB).(1)(2) Persistent phrenic nerve paresis (PPNP) has been reported after interscalene block (ISB) for shoulder surgery(3) but not after supraclavicular block (SCB). We present 2 cases of PPNP following US-guided SCB and shoulder surgery in the sitting position. Case 1: A 62 yo female underwent right total shoulder replacement (TSR) following a left TSR 14 weeks earlier under US-guided SCB. Her history was notable for morbid obesity (BMI 44.9). Pre-operative chest x-ray (CXR) was read as poor inspiratory effort and possible left basilar atelectasis (Fig 1). Following an US guided in-plane SCB with 55mL bupivacaine 0.25% plus dexamethasone PF 4 mg using a Chiba needle, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and the patient placed in the sitting position. Upon extubation, the patient complained of dyspnea and was hypoxic requiring assisted mask ventilation. (ABG: pH 7.20, PCO2 68 and PO2 117). Intraoperative fluoroscopic examination revealed bilateral diminished diaphragm function on deep inspiration. Comparison of the 2 preoperative CXRs (Fig 1) and (Fig 2) revealed a new contralateral (left) hemidiaphragmatic elevation. Postoperatively the patient required BiPAP for gt;24 hours. In retrospect, the patient had dyspnea and shortness of breath following her prior surgical procedure. (Figure presented) Case 2: A 59 yo male underwent arthroscopic right shoulder surgery in the sitting position. An US guided SCB was performed with an in-plane Chiba needle using 50mL of mepivacaine 1.5% and 10mL of bupivacaine 0.5% plus epinephrine 1:500,000. The patient was discharged home the same day. Several days later, he noted dyspnea while lying down to sleep and with normal activities. CXR revealed an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Following pulmonary function tests, a diagnosis of phrenic nerve paresis was made. MRI revealed multilevel C-Spine pathology. Discussion: We reported the incidence of PPNP following ISB for shoulder surgery in the sitting position as 1/2069.(3) It is possible that direct needle trauma to the phrenic nerve may occur with ISB and, potentially with rare anatomical variants, also SCB (4). However, anatomically, it is unlikely that the phrenic nerve would be directly injured during SCB. We propose that positioning and stretch cause PPNP. PPNP has been reported following minor cervical trauma (5), stretch injuries (6), chiropractic manipulation of the neck (7) and with C-Spine disease.(8) Brachial plexus monitoring during TSR under general anesthesia demonstrated nerve dysfunction in 57% of patients. (9) Anatomically, these cases of PPNP were likely secondary to the stretch and position and not SCB.

N2  - Purpose of study: Based on the recent success of intraarticular botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in patients with osteoarthritis, we hypothesized that intra-articular BoNT/A might be an effective nociceptive in patients with refractory arthroplasty pain. Methods used: Twelve patients with refractory chronic arthroplasty joint pain without any evidence of infection or prosthesis loosening were referred by orthopedic surgeons. After discussion of off-label use, each patient underwent intra-articular injection of BoNT/A. Patients reported pain on numeric rating scale (NRS) and function on composite validated scales, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) or Shoulder Pain and Disability (SPADI). The Institutional Ethics Committee approved this retrospective study. Summary of results: 12 patients (11 men, 1 woman) with 14 painful arthroplasty joints (2 bilateral; 12 knee and 2 shoulder) underwent >1 intra-articular BoNT/A injections (8 joints injected once, one joint injected twice, three joints injected 3 times, 2 joints injected 4 times) with doses ranging 100-500 U. Mean age was 70 years (standard deviation, 12) and follow-up ranged 1-15 months. Clinically meaningful reduction of two units in pain severity and really meaningful reduction in pain severity, defined as 50% reduction (defined by Farrar et al. 2001), were reported by 8/12 patients (8/14 joints) and 5/12 patients (5/14 joints), respectively, 1-3 months after their first intra-articular BoNT/A injection (100 U each). Improvements were noted in composite scales (WOMAC/SPADI) in patients who had improvement in pain. Two patients who responded to the first BoNT/A injection had similar reductions in pain severity with repeat injections. No significant adverse events were seen in any patients. Conclusions: A significant proportion of patients with chronic, refractory painful knee or shoulder arthroplasty responded to a single intra-articular injection of BoNT/A, which was sustained with repeat injections. Further study is needed to assess whether intra-articular BoNT/A could be a treatment choice in patients with refractory painful arthroplasty.

N2  - Objective. To investigate disease course, outcome, and predictors of outcome in an unselected population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) followed for 17 years. Methods. The cohort consisted of 132 incidence JCA cases identified 1984-1986 according to EULAR criteria. At 5-year followup, 129 individuals underwent joint assessment, laboratory measurements, radiographic examination, and medication and functional assessment. At 17-year followup, 86 were examined with joint assessment, laboratory measurements, medication assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Keitel functional test (KFT), and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Results. At 17-year followup, 40% were in remission, 44% changed subgroups, median HAQ score was 0.0 (range 0.0-1.5), and median KFT was 100 (range 54-100). SF-36 scores were significantly lower compared to a reference group. Thirty-nine percent of those in remission at 5-year followup were not in remission at 17-year followup. In multivariate analyses of variables from the 17-year followup: remission was predicted by remission at 5-year followup (OR 4.8); HAQ > 0 by rheumatoid factor (RF)-positivity at 5-year followup (OR 3.6); KFT < 100 by nonremission (OR 11.3); and RF-positivity (OR 5.6) at 5-year followup; and the SF-36 physical component summary score above average of the reference group by remission at 5-year followup (OR 5.8). Conclusion. This longterm study of 86 individuals with JCA showed large variability of disease courses and of impaired health-related quality of life. Sixty percent were not in remission at 17-year followup. Longterm outcome was best predicted by and associated with characteristics at 5-year followup rather than those at onset.

N2  - Background: Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a severe drug-induced syndrome involving a cutaneous eruption, hypereosinophilia, and internal organ injury. While the mainstay of treatment is cessation of the offending agent and steroids, there is a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of these practices. Furthermore, there are nearly 50 drugs implicated as potential causes of DRESS, making the determination of the culprit drug particularly challenging in the setting of polypharmacy. Case Report: A 79 year old woman with a history of multiple drug allergies develops an erythematous maculopapular rash 12 hours after receiving her third dose of vancomycin following an elective total shoulder arthroplasty. Red man syndrome is suspected, vancomycin is discontinued, and the patient is treated with diphenhydramine. Subsequently, the patient becomes somnolent, delirious, and oliguric. She then develops a left sided facial droop and slurred speech. Imaging of the brain shows ischemia in the posterior right frontal lobe. The rash evolves into larger erythematous patches and plaques. The following day, the patient develops a fever of 101.3F, leukocytosis of 16.8 with 7.0% eosinophils and atypical lymphocytes. Hepatic panel, previously normal, reveals elevated liver function tests. DRESS Syndrome is clinically suspected and punch biopsy corroborates the diagnosis. The patient is started on prednisone five days after the onset of rash. Fever, delirium, and neurologic deficits completely remit and laboratory values improve. Discussion: DRESS often presents with delayed symptom onset, typically 2-6 weeks after initiation of the culprit drug. Our patient was not taking the drugs most commonly associated with DRESS; however, her home medication list of 19 agents included aspirin, atorvastatin, and spironolactone, all of which have been linked to documented cases of DRESS. She had started ciprofloxacin several weeks prior to surgery for UTI prophylaxis. Quinolones have not been linked to DRESS Syndrome, but are known to cause drug hypersensitivity reactions. The patient received 17 other medications during her hospital stay including known culprit drugs toradol and vancomycin. The timing of the acute stroke raises the possibility that DRESS-associated systemic inflammation may lead to an increased risk of thromboembolism. This case highlights yet another risk associated with polypharmacy in the elderly.

N2  - A 73-year-old female, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), complicated with severe levels of joint destruction, started etanercept (ETN) because of high persistent RA disease activity. Although her articular symptoms dramatically improved, she developed marked pancytopenia after the introduction of ETN. Bone marrow aspirate specimen revealed hypocellular marrow in three hematopoietic series without atypical findings, which was compatible with aplastic anemia (AA). This is a rare case of severe pancytopenia due to AA presumably induced by ETN.

N2  - Few issues in regional anesthesia have generated as much controversy as whether peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) carry higher risk for neurologic complications in an anesthetized patient versus an awake patient.1,2 Opinions vary from heavy premedication being essential to the success of regional anesthesia to its being negligent. This is because regional anesthesiaassociated nerve injury is a major source of morbidity for patients, and a potential source of liability for both anesthesiologists and surgeons. PNBs are of particular concern because nerve block technique involves placing the needle tip in the immediate vicinity of the nerve or plexi and the concern is that needle-nerve contact in anesthetized patients may not elicit patients' responses and communication of the paresthesia. In the absence of the response, theoretically, the unabated needle advancement can go unchecked and result in nerve injury of intraneural injection. Unfortunately, no data or large-scale controlled studies on the safety of PNBs in awake versus anesthetized patients exist, nor are such studies likely to be available in the future. In the absence of randomized controlled studies on this issue, clinicians have drawn conclusions and made logic-based recommendations solely on their interpretation of the few available case reports, clinical experience, informal hear-say, and anecdotal discussions. Owing to the lack of data, firm recommendations published against the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia (GA) in patients receiving PNBs may have far-reaching medico-legal connotations that can be based on inaccurate and biased observations. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the available literature that supports or refutes the practice of administering nerve blocks in anesthetized patients. We will discuss the current controversies in the hopes to provide some additional insight into the problematic. Although case reports are often undervalued, they comprise a detailed account of events in specific patients as opposed to large epidemiologic studies that contain only limited detail regarding the block techniques. Therefore, in the absence of randomized controlled trials, we will place emphasis on what is known from the cases reports and series of cases. Symptoms of Intraneural Injection: The premise for performing PNBs only in awake patients is based on the supposition that an awake patient can provide information that will reduce the chance of intraneural injection and therefore decrease the risk for neurologic injury. If all intraneural injections are painful, the awake, protesting patient would seem to be the best monitor to prevent an intraneural injection. However, there are three limitations to this logic. First, a number of reports of intraneural or neurologic complications of PNBs in the literature have not been associated with pain on injection (Table 1). Second, the point at which pain occurs on injection may already be too late to prevent neurologic injury. For example, in the closed-claim study, Cheney and coworkers3 describe occasions where patients developed nerve injuries even though the anesthesiologist stopped the injection as soon as the patient reported pain. Indeed, studies utilizing animal models of intraneural injection suggest that nerve fascicles can be disrupted with miniscule amount injectates (e.g. as little as 0.1 mL) at the onset of the injection.4,5 Third, pain is notoriously difficult to assess in terms of quality and intensity, making it difficult to distinguish between the discomfort that is commonly reported on injection (which is considered normal) and that of intraneural injection. Of note, pain on administration of local anesthetic (LA) into nerve tissue may be absent even with centroneuraxial blocks. For instance, Kao et al.20 reported a case of nerve injury that was related to spinal cord trauma from a thoracic catheter that had been inserted while the patient had been under GA. However, the patient did not have pain during the administration of LA postoperatively. This is consistent with the observations of others that relying on pain to detect administration of LA into neural tissue is unreliable.21 The fundamental question remains what does one do with the paresthesia information. For instance, Fredrickson and colleagues18 reported that patients who experience paresthesia on needle placement have a higher risk of neurologic complications. However, apparently the report of paresthesia did not prevent the development of the nerve injury. Normal versus abnormal discomfort/pain on injection Injection of LA close to the nerves is often associated with discomfort on injection, resulting from ''spraying'' of the LAin the vicinity of the nerves.4,12,22 Dr. Alon Winnie6 famously coined the term pressure paresthesia and taught that this was a desirable sign of successful nerve localization and impending successful blockade for brachial plexus anesthesia. In actual clinical practice, however, variability of patient pain thresholds, individual patient's ability to verbalize a sensation of pain in the middle of a procedure, and an anesthesiologist's subjective interpretation of such responses make it very difficult to recommend where normal and abnormal pain or paresthesia on injection can be delineated. As an example, Barutell et al.23 reported a case of discomfort on injection that was perceived as ''normal pressure paresthesia''. Subsequently, the patient developed permanent neurologic damage although the discomfort had been detected by the patient and communicated to the anesthesia team. Unfounded commonly heard recommendations In the field of PNBs, a wide range of recommendations is often extrapolated from single observations. For instance,Walton et al.16 reported a case of brachial plexus palsy after total shoulder arthroplasty under an otherwise uneventful interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB). The authors concluded that PNBs should not be performed in anesthetized patients in order to minimize the risk for brachial plexus injury with ISB. Furthermore, the injection should be stopped immediately if paresthesia of ''unusual severity'' occurs. Ironically, their patient was neither anesthetized prior to the block nor had paresthesia or pain on injection. Similarly, Candido et al.17 found that paresthesia on needle insertion was associated with higher risk for persistent neurologic symptoms after ISB, however, no strategy was suggested on how to avoid it. Benumoff 24, on the other hand, reported 4 cases of severe neurologic injury that resulted in cervical paraplegia in patients receiving ISB under GA. This report had farreaching consequences within the anesthesia community, and many suggested that sedation and GA should be abandoned in order to decrease the risk for nerve injury.25 This appears to be an over-reaction inasmuch as none of the patients had peripheral nerve injury, and all of the patients had received an intracordal injection, a complication that can be prevented by restricting depth of needle insertion, by adopting more lateral and lower approaches to ISB (away from the centroneuraxis), and by using ultrasound guidance to monitor needle placement.26,27 Critics of ''heavy'' premedication and GA in this setting are reminded that the ISB is a superficial, relatively painless block procedure where excessive sedation and analgesia may not be necessary unless the patient requests heavy premedication before placing the block.28 In contrast, many other PNBs involve deeper placement of the needle and several attempts at nerve localization that may result in intense patient discomfort.29 Therefore, any generalized recommendations to avoid or limit premedication for PNBs carry the risk for limiting patient acceptance of PNBs. In one of the author's institutions, patients are sent an anesthesia satisfaction survey after their discharge home. Analyses of more than 5000 of these clearly indicate that the most satisfied patients are those with no recollection of any anesthetic procedure being done to them.[∗] Therefore, if PNBs are to be accepted by patients, adequate premedication and/or amnesia are necessary to avoid patient discomfort during needle placement. Does GA really increase the risk for neurologic complications after PNBs? Published data on complications of PNBs indicate that major neurologic injury after PNBs in awake patients occurs at a rate of 0.2%-0.4%.19,30,31 Most of these reports only included brachial plexus blocks, probably because these techniques are used more frequently than lower extremity nerve blocks. To date, no study has compared the risk for neurologic complications in awake versus anesthetized patients. In the report by Bogdanov and Loveland22, none of 548 patients who received an ISB after induction of GA developed permanent or long-term neurologic complications. Similarly, in a report presented at the 2005 Annual American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) Meeting, Tsai et al. presented the data on 226 PNBs of both upper and lower extremities, all performed in heavily sedated or anesthetized patients. None of the patients had neurologic complications. Bogdanov et al. used a modified approach to the classical ISB to reduce complications whereas Gadsden et al. used objective assessment of injection pressures to reduce the risk for intraneural injection during PNBs of both upper and lower extremities.4 These reports indicate that complications of PNBs may not be more common than complications reported in other similarly powered studies in awake patients. In fact, performance of PNBs in heavily premedicated patients or after induction of GA is probably a common practice. A recent informal poll conducted during the ASRA 2005 session on complications of PNBs indicated that approximately half of the attendees practiced blocks in heavily sedated or anesthetized patients.

N2  - Description of case: A 72-year-old man presented with acute on chronic right shoulder pain on a background of bilateral shoulder replacements for osteoarthritis. A CT arthrogram of that shoulder had been performed 4 days previously. Eight millilitres of radiographic contrast had been injected into the joint space. The proceduralist had used aseptic technique and skin preparation with 0.5% alcoholic chlorhexidine but did not wear a mask. Within 24 hours the shoulder pain dramatically worsened with swelling and decreased range of movement. Ultrasound guided aspiration recovered a highly infl ammatory fl uid with 1+ Gram positive cocci. Culture yielded light growth Streptococcus mitis group 1 and scant Haemophilus parainfl uenzae on the primary plates. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics prior to later successful revision of his shoulder prosthesis. The proceduralist agreed to provide an oropharyngeal swab. Several organisms were cultured, including multiple viridans Streptococcus species. Pulsed fi eld gel electrophoresis using two different restriction enzymes demonstrated no significant differences between the patient's organism and a strain of Streptococcus mitis recovered from the proceduralist's throat. This strongly suggested droplet transmission onto the skin with subsequent inoculation into the shoulder joint. Review of past isolates of viridans Streptococcus species in our laboratory from joint fl uid with infl ammatory cell counts over the past 5 years revealed several possible cases with a recent prior history of joint injection suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. None of the cases received full treatment for septic arthritis as the organisms were dismissed as contaminants. Viridans Streptococcus species have been implicated in other settings as nosocomial pathogens, most spectacularly with bacterial meningitis following spinal anaesthesia. On rare occasions molecular confi rmation of the source in the oropharynx of the proceduralist was documented. This case exemplifi es that a surgical facial mask is an essential element of infection control during procedures involving injection into a sterile site. Issues of interest in the case 1. Use of surgical face mask is essential even in procedures carried out by physicians outside the context of the operating theatre, and is commonly overlooked 2. The case demonstrates the nexus between clinical and laboratory medicine, and the use of basic science to confi rm a suspicion generated by clinical history taking 3. Obtaining molecular confi rmation of the source of nosocomial transmission is rare 4. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci, which are commonly dismissed as nonpathogenic by the laboratory, may be of significance when isolated from sterile sites and further history of previous medical intervention should be sought.

N2  - Shoulder osteoarthritis affect about 32% of patients over 60 years. Conservative treatment are recommended to restore shoulder function while shoulder arthroplasty remains the standard treatment for severe osteoarthritis. When conservative therapies fail and surgical approach is precluded, viscosupplementation with HA may be the treatment of choice. Currently, there is minimal information available comparing the results of Hylan G-F 20 and corticosteroid injections for the treatment of shoulder osteoarthritis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the results of these two treatments at specific time points with validated outcome measurements. Retrospective comparative cohort study. The study population included 84 patients, 51 of whom treated with Hylan G-F 20 and 33 with a corticosteroid. Gleno-humeral osteoarthritis was graded according to Samilson-Prieto classification and rotator cuff was assessed with MRI. Both groups received three injections 1 week apart and were evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and the Constant-Murley scale. Outcomes were registered at 1, 3, and 6 months. The Hylan G-F 20 group showed a significant pain reduction (P < 0.05), improvement in the Constant-Murley, SPADI scores (P < 0.05), and satisfaction (P < 0.01) at all three follow-up times. Pain, clinical scores, and subjective satisfaction in the corticosteroid group improved in the first post treatment month only (P < 0.05) compared with the baseline. Overall, lower clinical advantages were found in patients with greater degree of osteoarthritis and rotator cuff tears. Intra-articular injections with Hylan G-F 20 are effective in reducing pain for up to 6 months in gleno-humeral osteoarthritis whereas corticosteroids injections resulte in improvement at 1 month only. In patients with severe osteoarthritis and/or full-thickness, RC tears results tended to be worse.

N2  - Case Reports: Cricoarythenoid joint arthritis as a result of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a known condition that rarely results in bilateral vocal cord paralysis. We describe the first case of iatrogenic regional anesthetic vocal cord (VC) paralysis in the setting of contra-lateral cricoarythenoid joint (CJ) ankylosis and immobility. A 70 year old male, with rheumatoid arthritis, was admitted for pain control, after a left total shoulder arthroplasty. Due to his pain, a left sided interscalene (IS) nerve block was done, which resulted in immediate pain control but was also followed by stridor. Racemic epinephrine and 10 mg of IV dexamethasone was administered for presumptive acute edema. Patient's oxygen saturation was 97% on 3 L of O2. However the patient had severe air hunger and stridor with a respiratory rate of 28. Heliox (70/30 mixture) was initiated resulting in major symptomatic relief. Otolaryngology performed a flexible laryngoscopy and revealed bilateral VC in midline position with twitching of the left VC, immobile right VC and minimal glottis gap. No edema or traumatic injury to the VC was seen. Patient was thought to have bilateral VC dysfunction, with a right VC immobility due to fixation of the CJ and an iatrogenic left cord paralysis from the left sided IS block. Patient was transferred to the ICU, on Heliox. Repeat laryn-goscopy at 12 hours showed immobile right VC, but more activity of the left VC with sniffing. Patient's left VC showed slow functional return over 72 hours and Heliox was discontinued. In outpatient follow up the patient's VC function had returned to baseline. Bilateral VC paralysis from cricoarythenoid joint arthritis in the setting of RA can on rare occasions lead to significant stridor and can require tracheostomy. Unilateral involvement of the CJ may not pose such deleterious events, but must be recognized through complete ENT evaluation, especially before anesthesia or nerve block. To our knowledge there is no reported case of unilateral CJarthritis and immobility complicatedbyiatrogenic contra lateral VC paralysis. Acute management with Heliox can help alleviate symptoms and improve air flow until the VC function return.

N2  - Perioperative nerve injury (PNI) can result in functional impairment and chronic neuropathic pain. Several large retrospective studies estimate that the overall incidence of PNI has been on the decrease since 2000. However, the true incidence remains unclear and is likely under-reported. The most common mechanism of PNI is nerve ischemia (stretching, compression, or direct injuries). Although the symptoms may resolve over time, some require more than one year to achieve maximal neurologic recovery. Causes for PNI are multifactorial. A number of pre-existing co-morbidities have been associated with the development of PNI. These conditions include diabetes, tobacco use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, vascular disease, and thyroid diseases. Other comorbidities likely related to PNI are obesity, cachexy, and pregnancy. Furthermore, asymptomatic patients with spinal stenosis or cervical spinal abnormalities are at increased risk for PNI. In orthopedic patients, the presence of valgus deformity, flexion contraction, and rheumatoid arthritis are also considered risk factors for developing PNI. Preoperative factors such as hypovolemia, hypotension, dehydration, anemia and hypoxemia can also increase the incidence of PNI. Additionally, the presence of anticoagulation further contributes to the occurrence of PNI. Surgical positioning and types of surgery are both related to the incidence of PNI. Lithotomy, lateral, prone and sitting positions have been shown to increase PNI. Significant number of patients developed persistent postsurgical pain after undergoing neurosugery, cardiac [6], general and orthopedic surgeries, especially with in the sett ing of prolonged surgerical duration. Laparoscopic surgery has been associated with PNI secondary to extreme patient positioning leading to compression and stretching of the nerves and prolonged operative times. The most frequently injured nerves are the ulnar nerve, brachial plexus and peroneal nerve; but ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, obturator and genitofemoral nerves can also be involved with some abdominal surgical approach. Persistent postoperative pain is a frequent phenomenon after orthopedic surgeries. A recent study found that 44% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 27% of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients reported persistent postoperative pain 3 to 4 years after their surgeries (15% severe pain and 6% extreme pain). Moreover, 13% of the patients with persistent pain after TKA and 5% of those after THA had pain that was likely neuropathic in origin. During TKA, the incidence of PNI is as high as 10%. The risk is significantly higher among patients undergoing bilateral procedures. The incidence of neuropathy after THAvaries significantly between 0.3% and 4%, which may reflect the wide range of surgical approaches. The electromyographic abnormalities are present in 70% of the cases, which confirms that clinical examination alone underestimates PNI. Common peroneal, posterior tibial, sciatic, femoral nerves are most likely to be involved; but superior gluteal or obturator nerves are also at risk. Other surgical factors that increase the risk of PNI during THA are lengthening of the leg (94cm), usage of cement, congenital dislocation, hemorrhage, and prolonged surgical duration. A large majority of nerve injuries have been reported to occur with the use of lateral decubitus position and subsequent traction during shoulder surgeries. In the beach-chair position, head and neck malpositioning and arterial hypotension have been associated with spinal cord injury. Although claims for cervical cord injury are rare, the consequence can be severe and disabling. The risk of PNI is increased when converting from arthroscopy to an open procedure or during a bilateral procedure. Glenoid component screw placement during shoulder replacement poses additional risk to the suprascapular nerve. General anesthesia (GA) is often sited as a risk factor for PNI secondary to malpositioning and immobility. Other imposing factors include hypothermia and compartment syndrome (pre- or postoperative) as both can jeopardize the viability of the nerve by compromising the blood supply. Under GA, upper extremity injuries are more common than that of lower extremity. Superficial nerves, such as the ulnar (which accounts for one third of PNI) and common peroneal nerves are especially vulnerable to becoming injured. Due to its anatomy, ulnar nerve compression at the level of the elbow represents the second most frequent compression neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Pain after surgery is usually perceived as nociceptive pain. Both surgical trauma and opioids are known to induce hyperalgesia. Some of the current analgesics used in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain demonstrate proven efficacy in reducing pain intensity, opioid consumption, and opioidrelated adverse effects after surgery. For example, gabapentinoids such as pregabalin and gabapentin have their efficacy confirmed by meta-analysis. The risk of developing PNI after neuraxial (epidural more than spinal) anesthesia is reported to be higher than after peripheral nerve blocks, but this is still debated. The risk of clinically significant PNI after RA is evaluated between 0.1% and 0.004%. However, the severity of neurologic disturbance due to surgery is difficult to evaluate; given this difficulty some authors estimate the incidence of transient neurologic symptoms to be between 8 to 10%. The risk of PNI is not increased while using regional anesthesia (RA) for oprthopedic procedures as illustrated by a recent study on RA for TKA. It is proposed that ultrasound (US) guidance could decrease the risk of intraneural injection. The estimated incidence of unintentional intraneural injection under neurostimulation (NS) is greater than 80%, while the incidence under US seems to be significantly reduced to 17%. Moreover, intraneural injection under US is immediately detected and terminated in 50% of the cases. The risk of PNI can be reduced with the use of the blunt needles as opposed to the long beveled needles, but not to the small short beveled needles. While a large needle diameter is needed to facilitate catheter insertion, the larger needle gauge can elicit a more pronounced nerve injury in the case of nerve perforation. The use of local anesthetics with lower concentration likely reduces the risk of neurotoxicity. However careful attention to adjuvants and WrecipesW must be made as there is an absence of definitive neurotoxicity evaluation. The risk of PNI due to peripheral nerve catheter remains debated. In order to avoid the formation of hematoma, management of anticoagulation must be adjusted with the timing of the insertion and removal of catheters.

N2  - Background and aims: Rovenstine first described a landmark technique for the suprascapular nerve block(SSNB) in 1941. Since then it has been used with varying degrees of success in conditions causing chronic shoulder pain. With NICE guidelines recommending the use of ultrasound(US) for regional nerve blocks, we present what is to our knowledge only the second report of an US guided SSNB for chronic shoulder pain. Methods: A SSNB was performed under local anaesthetic with US guidance. The hyperchoic nerve was visualised in the suprascapular notch at a depth of 4cm. An inplane approach, using a nerve stimulator to minimise the risk of intra-neuronal injection was applied. When the needle was visualised in close approximation to the nerve, 5mls of 0.5% levobupivicaine with 40mg of triamcinolone was injected after negative aspiration. Results: Pain, sleep disturbance and functional limitation were measured. Overall there was 'decreased intensity' of pain over the six weeks studied (Table 1). Sleep quality was also 'generally improved'. (Table presented) Conclusions: We suggest that SSNB can provide a viable part of a comprehensive pain management programme for patients who are either; considered too 'high risk' for joint replacement, or who have little to gain from shoulder arthroplasty because of pre-existing muscle damage. Patients must be willing to accept the motor disability associated with the procedure which is likely to be performed as a series of regular injections.

N2  - Introduction. Pituitary apoplexy following a major surgical procedure is a catastrophic event and the diagnosis can be delayed in a previously asymptomatic patient. The decision on thromboprophylaxis in shoulder replacements in the absence of definite guidelines, rests on a careful clinical judgment. Case presentation. A previously healthy 62-year-old Caucasian male patient who underwent shoulder arthroplasty developed hyponatremia resistant to correction with saline replacement. The patient had a positive family history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and heparin thromboprophylaxis was considered on clinical grounds. The patient developed hyponatremia resistant to conventional treatment and later developed ocular localizing signs with oculomotor nerve palsy. The diagnosis was delayed due to other confounding factors in the immediate post-operative period. Subsequent workup confirmed a pituitary adenoma with features of pituitary insufficiency. The patient was managed successfully on conservative lines with a multidisciplinary approach. Conclusions: A high index of suspicion is required in the presence of isolated post-operative hyponatremia resistant to medical correction. A central cause, in particular pituitary adenoma, should be suspected early. Thromboprophylaxis in shoulder replacements needs careful consideration as it may be a contributory factor in precipitating this life-threatening condition. © 2011 Madhusudhan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Purpose There is currently limited information available in the orthopaedic surgery literature regarding the appropriate management of symptomatic partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials of all published literature pertaining to the arthroscopic management of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Inclusion criteria were all studies that reported clinical outcomes after arthroscopic treatment of both articular-sided and bursal-sided lesions using a validated outcome scoring system and a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Data abstracted from the selected studies included tear type and location (articular v bursal sided), treatment approach, postoperative rehabilitation protocol, outcome scores, patient satisfaction, and postoperative imaging results. Results Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for the final analysis. Seven of the studies treated partial-thickness rotator cuff tears with debridement with or without an associated subacromial decompression, 3 performed a takedown and repair, 5 used a transtendon repair technique, and 1 used a transosseous repair method. Among the 16 studies reviewed, excellent postoperative outcomes were reported in 28.7% to 93% of patients treated. In all 12 studies with available preoperative baseline data, treatment resulted in significant improvement in shoulder symptoms and function. For high-grade lesions, the data support arthroscopic takedown and repair, transtendon repairs, and transosseous repairs, with all 3 techniques providing a high percentage of excellent results. Debridement of partial-thickness tears of less than 50% of the tendon's thickness with or without a concomitant acromioplasty also results in good to excellent surgical outcomes; however, a 6.5% to 34.6% incidence of progression to full-thickness tears is present. Conclusions This systematic review of 16 clinical studies showed that significant variation is present in the results obtained after the arthroscopic management of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. What can be supported by the available data is that tears that involve less than 50% of the tendon can be treated with good results by debridement of the tendon with or without a formal acromioplasty, although subsequent tear progression may occur. When the tear is greater than 50%, surgical intervention focusing on repair has been successful. There is no evidence to suggest a differential in outcome for tear completion and repair versus transtendon repair of these lesions because both methods have been shown to result in favorable outcomes.

N2  - A commonly cited contraindication to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is deficient glenoid bone stock. Deficient glenoid bone stock can lead to inadequate glenoid baseplate fixation and, eventually, glenoid component loosening and prosthesis failure. However, with improved prosthetic designs and increased surgeon experience, indications for use of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty continue to expand to include shoulders that would have previously seemed doomed to failure if treated with a reverse prosthesis. In this article, 3 cases are presented, 1 of cuff tear arthropathy and 2 of chronic anterior dislocations, in whom primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty was performed despite the presence of severe glenoid bone deficiency. Corticocancellous bone grafting was used at the time of the reverse arthroplasty to augment the deficient glenoid and allow for simultaneous and adequate glenoid component fixation. All 3 cases showed excellent results in short-term follow-up, providing surgeons with an option for how to treat these difficult shoulders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aims: To determine what clinical factors relating to efficacy besides complications of orthopedic surgery for patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy (infliximab), we analyzed the clinical data of 52 cases of orthopedic surgery, such as total hip arthroplasy (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total shoulder arthroplasy (TSA), total elbow arthroplasty (TEA), arthroscopic synovectomy, foot arthroplasty, spine surgery, hand surgery and fracture. Methods: We analyzed clinical factors including age, disease duration, preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), disease activity score (DAS)-28, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and rheumatoid arthritis particle-agglutination (RAPA) in 52 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) undergoing orthopedic surgery. For complications of orthopedic surgery, signs of postoperative infection were recorded, including rubor, discharge, systemic infection and frequencies of wound dehiscence, as well as the incidence of any surgical complication requiring a secondary revision procedure were measured. Results: Signs of infection or surgical complications occurred in two of 52 patients (3.8%). There is significant correlation between RAPA and improvement of CRP 3months after surgery; however, there is no correlation between infection and clinical factors including age, disease duration, preoperative CRP, MMP-3, RAPA and the period until surgery after infliximab infusion. Conclusion: Infliximab did not increase the risk of either infections or surgical complications occurring in patients with RA within 1year of orthopedic surgery. Improvement of CRP after surgery is likely to be due to infliximab for high RAPA in RA patients. © 2010 The Authors.

N2  - Failure after rotator cuff surgery represents a difficult and challenging problem. Patients may complain of persistent pain, stiffness, weakness or loss of function, usually loss of active anterior elevation, but often loss of active external rotation, with impairment in activities of daily living. Patients with pain and preserved function often are adequately treated with physiotherapy, steroid injection, or procedures such as repair for a reparable tear, debridement, biceps tenotomy or tenodesis, partial repair or tendon transfers for irreparable tears, or hemiarthroplasty in the presence of glenohumeral arthritis. However, patients with loss of function often are not adequately treated by any of these methods and often require a reverse shoulder arthroplasty, which can improve function in selected patients. However, results are lower than primary surgery, with a higher complication rate. As experience and technology continue to advance, newer treatment options may offer further promise for this challenging patient population. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3-6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis as well as on the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical interventions for shoulder pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Objective. TNF-α blockers reportedly increase the risk of complications in rheumatic patients following surgery. Whereas deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a significant complication after orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs, the risk for DVT in RA patients receiving TNF blockers remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify complications that can be attributed to the use of TNF-α blocker therapy. Methods. In a retrospective 1:1 pair-matched case-control study, 64 anti-TNF-treated RA surgeries (TNF group) and 64 surgeries treated with conventional DMARDs (DMARDS group) were evaluated for surgical site infection (SSI), DVT and recurrence of arthritis (flare-up). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association of SSI or DVT with the putative risk factors. Results. Regression analysis identified the use of TNF blockers as a risk factor for SSI [P = 0.036; odds ratio (OR) = 21.80] and development of DVT (P = 0.03; OR = 2.83) after major orthopaedic surgery: 12.5% (8/64) of the patients in the TNF group had SSI, whereas 2% (1/64) of those in the DMARDs group had SSI. Fifty-one per cent (23/45) of the TNF group, but only 26% (12/45) of the DMARDs group was DVT positive. Flare-ups during the perioperative period were found in 17.2% (11/64) of all patients, and no delay in wound healing occurred in either group. Conclusions. These data suggest that the use of TNF blockers is a likely cause of SSI and DVT development in RA patients following major orthopaedic surgery. © The Author 2009.

N2  - Background Little is known about the rate and factors of progression of shoulder osteonecrosis (ON) related to corticosteroids. Purpose We retrospectively evaluated 125 patients (215 shoulders) with humeral head ON diagnosed by MRI to determine the delay between corticosteroid treatment and the different stages and factors influencing the progression of the disease. Methods Seventy-four of the shoulders had asymptomatic Stage I ON, 58 had asymptomatic Stage II ON, 46 had symptomatic Stage I ON, and 37 had symptomatic Stage II ON. The minimum followup was 10 years (average, 14 years; range, 10-20 years). The delay between the beginning of the corticosteroid treatment and the diagnosis of ON of the humeral head averaged 15 months (range, 624 months). Results We observed partial or total regression on MRI only in patients with asymptomatic Stage I ON. At last followup, pain had developed in 98 (74%) and collapse had occurred in 71 (54%) of the 132 previously asymptomatic shoulders. Of the 83 symptomatic shoulders, 68 (82%) had collapsed at the final followup. The time between diagnosis and collapse averaged 10 years for patients with symptomatic Stage I ON and 3 years for patients with symptomatic Stage II ON. Conclusions Stage at initial visit, occurrence of pain, and continuation of peak doses of corticosteroids predicted progression of disease in asymptomatic shoulders, whereas in the symptomatic shoulders, extent and location of the lesion were the main risk factors for progression.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Shoulder pain is a common problem with an estimated prevalence of 4% to 26%. About 1% of adults aged over 45 years consult their GP with a new presentation of shoulder pain every year in the UK. The aetiology of shoulder pain is diverse and includes pathology originating from the neck, glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, rotator cuff, and other soft tissues around the shoulder girdle. The most common source of shoulder pain is the rotator cuff, accounting for over two-thirds of cases.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatment, topical drug treatment, local injections, non-drug treatment, and surgical treatment? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS: We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, arthroscopic subacromial decompression, autologous whole blood injection, corticosteroids (oral, subacromial injection, or intra-articular injection), electrical stimulation, excision of distal clavicle, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ice, laser treatment, manipulation under anaesthesia, suprascapular nerve block, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (oral, topical or intra-articular injection), opioid analgesics, paracetamol, physiotherapy (manual treatment, exercises), platelet-rich plasma injection, rotator cuff repair, shoulder arthroplasty, and ultrasound.

N2  - Shoulder disorders are a common and sometimes underestimated cause of pain and disability in elderly people. Prevalence of shoulder disorders in the elderly community is 21% and this represents important implications in the provision of community health services. Shoulder disorders are more common in women (25%) than in men (17%). Although many of these patients do not seek medical advice, shoulder pain is a frequent cause of disability, poor subjective perception of health and depression. Soft tissue lesions are the most common cause of shoulder pain in the elderly, including rotator cuff tendinitis or rupture, subacromial impingement, frozen shoulder and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. These conditions are amenable to treatment that in turn will improve patient quality of life. Minimally invasive techniques, especially shoulder arthroscopy, have demonstrated to be extremely useful for this purpose. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis, rheumatoid disease and Milwaukee shoulder are also frequent origins of shoulder ache. In these entities associated with joint destruction, shoulder replacement achieves excellent clinical results and survival rates comparable with knee or hip arthroplasty. Another common cause of shoulder problems in the elderly is fractures of the proximal humerus. These fractures should be regarded as typical osteoporotic fractures, and their incidence is increasing dramatically. They constitute the third most frequent osteoporotic fracture after vertebral and distal radius fractures and usually occur in active people. Half of these fractures are displaced and require surgical treatment. Since proximal humeral fractures usually occur at a younger age than hip fractures, they represent an important warning, forecasting more severe osteoporotic fractures. © 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - There have been marked changes in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) over recent decades, mainly with earlier use of methotrexate (MTX). Our aim was to describe orthopaedic interventions in a large group of adults with JIA followed up over several decades. This was a retrospective observational study of adult JIA patients attending a teaching hospital clinic, with information collated on JIA subtype, disease duration, orthopaedic interventions, and exposure to MTX. The study included 144 patients with median disease duration of 19 years. Survival analysis showed that joint surgery was observed in the majority (75%) of patients with disease duration over 40 years with a trend for less joint surgery in patients with oligoarticular JIA. In total, 41 patients (28.5%) had received joint surgery, and 17/41 (41%) have required multiple procedures. Of those who have required joint surgery, 20/41 (48%) had started MTX in their adult years, with only 5/41 (12%), starting MTX prior to first joint replacement and none within 5 years of disease onset. Of the patients who have not had joint surgery to date, most (46/103, 45%) were receiving MTX or another immunosuppressive agent; in the majority of cases, MTX was started within 2 years of disease onset. Many adults with JIA require joint replacement surgery and ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, emphasising that JIA is not a benign disease. Many patients who have had joint replacement surgery have had exposure to MTX albeit after many years after disease onset; it remains to be seen whether patients who have received MTX therapy early in their disease course will ultimately have less requirement for joint surgery. © 2009 Clinical Rheumatology.

N2  - Objectives: To understand the acute phase responses to surgical intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with the anti-interleukin (IL)6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab. Methods: In a retrospective 1:1 pair-matched case-control study, 22 tocilizumab-treated RA cases and 22 cases treated with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and matched for type of surgery, age and sex were evaluated for body temperature every day, and blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts on days -1, 1, 3 and weeks 1 and 2 after joint surgery. Safety issues were also monitored. Results: No complications of infection or delay of wound healing occurred in either patient group. Tocilizumab partially, but significantly, suppressed the increase in body temperature on postoperative days 1 and 2, compared with DMARDs (average (SD) maximum increase in temperature was 0.45 (0.1)°C in the tocilizumab group and 0.78 (0.1)°C in the DMARD group; p<0.01). Tocilizumab completely suppressed the increase in CRP after surgery, whereas all cases treated with DMARDs showed a significant increase of CRP at postoperative day 1 (5.5 (0.6) mg/dl; p<0.001). WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts showed no remarkable change after surgery, and there was no significant difference in any cell counts between the patient groups. Conclusions: Within this small number of cases, safe operations on patients were performed during tocilizumab treatment. Tocilizumab suppressed fever and increase of CRP after surgery, whereas there was no influence on the transition in number of leukocytes. This characteristic postoperative response should be considered during tocilizumab treatment.

N2  - Summary: Massive tears of the rotator cuff resulting in arthritis of the glenohumeral joint remain a difficult challenge. Although cuff tear arthropathy (CTA) has been recognized for more than 150 years, a treatment strategy with uniformly satisfactory outcomes remains elusive, partly due to the difficulty in defining CTA in the literature. Most studies combine true CTA, rheumatoid arthritis, and massive rotator cuff tears under the CTA diagnosis. Determining outcomes from these studies is difficult. Hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty have led to pain relief, but the high rate of glenoid component loosening after total shoulder arthroplasty is a concern, and active range of motion remains limited after hemiarthroplasty. There is increasing interest in the use of a constrained or reverese total shoulder arthroplasty to treat this complex process, with promising early results. This review article studies current trends in the diagnosis and management of arthritis due to massive cuff tears and CTA. Level of evidence: Non-systematic review article. © 2009 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - While much literature has focused on the management of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, far less information is available regarding the treatment and outcomes of this disease in the proximal humerus. To a great extent, management of humeral head osteonecrosis has been inferred from studies involving the femoral head. The etiologies for this disease can be categorized most usefully as traumatic versus atraumatic. Regardless of the underlying etiology, the common pathway involves disruption of the arterial inflow or the venous outflow of the bone, with resultant osseous cell death. The general treatment strategies for humeral head osteonecrosis include nonoperative modalities for symptomatic early disease, with surgical intervention reserved for more advanced disease or those with recalcitrant pain.

N2  - There are multiple reports in the literature of chondrolysis following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Although the etiology of these cases is not known for certain, there has been speculation that radiofrequency devices, young patient age, instability surgery, intra-articular pain pumps, and type of anesthetic may be precipitating factors. This article describes a case of a 37-year-old law enforcement officer who injured both shoulders and ultimately underwent nearly identical bilateral procedures: arthroscopic superior labrum anteroposterior (SLAP) repair, Bankart repair, capsulorrhaphy, acromioplasty, and distal clavicle excision. Intra-articular pain catheters were placed following both procedures, but the right-sided catheter never functioned properly, as evidenced by continuous leakage outside of her body until it was removed. Subsequently she had an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions done for residual stiffness, in which the left humeral head and glenoid cavity were noted to be completely devoid of articular cartilage. Over the ensuing months, multiple cortisone injections, 5 viscosupplementation injections, physical therapy, and narcotics all failed to relieve her left shoulder pain. Radiographs showed significant left glenohumeral joint space narrowing and a normal-appearing joint space on the right. Our impression was postsurgical chondrolysis of the left shoulder. The patient has recently undergone humeral hemiarthroplasty with nonprosthetic glenoid arthroplasty. This case differs from others reported in the literature in that nearly identical bilateral procedures were performed by the same surgeon, yet chondrolysis only developed on the side that had a functioning postoperative pain catheter.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of patients with osteonecrosis of the humeral head, based on etiology and treatment with either hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Sixty-four shoulders, with an average age of 57 years, were evaluated at a mean of 4.8 years. Outcomes included L'Insalata and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, as well as range of motion (ROM). The overall ASES score was 67, average flexion was 127°, and external rotation was 49°. Outcomes did not differ based on etiology, but ROM was decreased with post-traumatic osteonecrosis. There was no difference in outcome or ROM between hemiarthroplasty and TSA. The complication rate was significantly higher with TSA (22%) than with hemiarthroplasty (8%). Achieving ROM in patients with post-traumatic osteonecrosis remains difficult. TSA was associated with a higher complication rate and decreased mobility and should be reserved for patients with stage V osteonecrosis. © 2008 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Many surgical treatment options exist for cuff tear arthropathy, but in our opinion, the most reliable options include the unconstrained hemiarthroplasty and the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Currently our indications for a hemiarthroplasty consist of a patient with a contained head, no superior migration (Seebauer 1A and 1B), no previous violation of the coracoacromial arch, reasonable preoperative range of motion, and younger age. On the other hand, we believe indications for a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty include the older patient with a pseudoparalytic shoulder, superior migration (Seebauer type 2A or 2B), and loss of the coracoacromial arch. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Cement fixation, press-fit, and bone ingrowth/ongrowth have all been utilized successfully for humeral component fixation. Although press-fit fixation is appealing for use in a young person requiring a prosthetic replacement with concerns about future revision, its use has not been universally predictable and has sometimes resulted in need for early revision due to implant loosening. Most textured surfaces with or without hydroxyapetite coating for purposes of bone ingrowth/ongrowth have proven to show little improvement over standard press fit implants except in cup arthroplasty surface replacement. Newer technologies of tantlum weave (trabecular metal) segments on humeral implants have suggested the ability to have bone growth through the prosthesis and literally heal to the prosthesis. This technology presents advantages especially in fracture cases where tuberosities have notoriously had a high rate of nonunion, but its track record is still limited. Careful canal preparation, use of a cement restrictor, modern cement preparation techniques, and careful injection under gentle pressure with use of an appropriate-sized prosthesis remains the mainstay of fixation for humeral implants in 2007. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Glenohumeral joint arthritis is a disabling condition, especially when it occurs in athletes. The functional impairments these patients experience seriously impact their sports participation and activities of daily living. This condition in young people is quite challenging for the physician. This article outlines the common etiologies, presentation, and diagnosis of arthritis in the athletic population. A treatment algorithm is outlined that ranges from conservative modalities to surgery.

N2  - Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a relatively uncommon cause of glenohumeral arthritis. Previous retrospective reviews of shoulder arthroplasty for AVN have shown very good results in small numbers of patients. This study prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 21 shoulders in 19 patients treated with the same modular prosthesis at a single institution. Of the shoulders, 8 developed AVN after a proximal humeral fracture, 1 was associated with a massive rotator cuff tear, 10 developed after corticosteroid therapy, and 2 were idiopathic. The patients, 14 women and 5 men, with a mean age of 54 years, were followed up for a mean of 4.7 years (range, 2 to 8 years). Hemiarthroplasty was performed in 15 shoulders, whereas 6 required total shoulder arthroplasty. Assessment included visual analog scales, the Simple Shoulder Test, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score Index (SSI). Physical examination was performed, and radiographs were obtained. The visual analog scale scores for pain and function improved significantly after surgery (P < .01). The mean SSI score rose from 36 to 81 (where 0 indicates the worst outcome and 100 indicates the best outcome). The mean number of positive responses on the Simple Shoulder Test increased from 3 to 10. Mean active elevation increased from 88° to 123°. External rotation improved from 7° to 34°, and internal rotation improved from L4 to T12. No difference in outcome was noted based on age or sex. Patients with steroid-related or idiopathic AVN had greater pain and functional impairment preoperatively (mean SSI score, 26) than those with prior fracture or rotator cuff tear (mean SSI score, 49) (P < .01). Postoperatively, however, these groups fared equally well (mean SSI score, 78 vs 82). Shoulder arthroplasty for AVN produces good pain relief and function, although a concurrent series with osteoarthritis yielded better results. Forward elevation did not approach normal as had been previously reported. © 2007 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

N2  - Shoulder pain is usually caused by a small number of relatively common conditions. Clinical history and examination are essential in the diagnosis of shoulder pain, after which investigations often assist in confirming the diagnosis. One of the commonest causes of shoulder pain is rotator cuff disease, which can be due to impingement syndrome (where the acromion impinges on the supraspinatus tendon) or by tears to the rotator cuff muscles. Both conditions can be managed with physiotherapy, but surgery (subacromial decompression, arthroscopic cuff repair) may be indicated. Frozen shoulder is a chronic condition often affecting middle-aged women. It can follow a period of immobility or minor trauma and is usually managed with physiotherapy. Calcific tendonitis is caused by calcium deposition in the supraspinatus tendon and causes severe pain; calcium deposits on plain radiographs are diagnostic. Symptoms gradually settle over time in most cases, but surgical intervention may be indicated. Degenerative disease (e.g. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis) can also cause shoulder pain and shoulder arthroplasty may be indicated. Shoulder dislocations can lead to an unstable shoulder joint that is prone to recurrent dislocation. Surgery may be required to stabilize the shoulder and repair damage to the labrum or humeral head. Other, less common, causes of shoulder pain (e.g. infection, neuralgic amyotrophy, tumour) are also briefly considered in this review. © 2006.

N2  - The fate of shoulder arthroplasties in transplant recipients is unknown but potential concerns include the immunocom- promised state and inferior bone quality of these patients. We retrospectively reviewed five shoulder arthroplasties performed from January 1, 1985 to December 31, 2001 in four patients who previously had transplant surgery. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years (mean, 5.4 years). The results were graded according to a modified Neer result rating system. There were four excellent results and one satisfactory result. There were no intraoperative complications, infections, or revisions. In this limited group of patients the results of shoulder arthroplasty after transplantation were satisfactory. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Cuff-tear arthropathy is a progressive and often disabling pathologic process affecting the shoulder. With a growing elderly population, the incidence is increasing. Initial treatment is conservative; however, when conservative treatment fails then surgery is indicated. To date, the best results for the surgical treatment of cuff-tear arthropathy appear to be for patients treated with hemiarthroplasty. This report reviews our use of hemiarthroplasty with extended-coverage humeral head prosthesis in the surgical management of cuff-tear arthropathy.

N2  - Nineteen shoulder arthroplasties for the treatment of nontraumatic avascular necrosis of the humeral head were evaluated. The osteonecrosis was idiopathic in 6 shoulders, was a result of corticotherapy in 10, occurred after radiation in 2, and occurred after Gaucher's disease in 1. A total shoulder arthroplasty was performed in 5 cases and a hemiarthroplasty in 14. At 7 years' follow-up (range, 2 to 12 years), there were 7 excellent, 9 satisfactory, and 3 unsatisfactory results. The Constant score averaged 58 points, for an adjusted score of 78%. Radiolucent lines were present around 2 glenoid components, and 1 was radiographically loose. In 2 cases with humeral head replacement, there was painful glenoid wear. Shoulder arthroplasty for nontraumatic avascular necrosis yields satisfactory results with a pain-free shoulder in more than 80% of cases. However, limitation of motion often persists. Better results can be expected with shorter preoperative delay, when preoperative pain is moderate and range of motion preserved and when the etiology is not postradiation avascular necrosis, which in our series yielded the worst results.

N2  - Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis may result from trauma, concomitant shoulder pathology, or crystal deposition disease, or it may have no discernible cause. The physical examination reveals muscular atrophy, abnormalities during palpation, and limited range of motion, particularly in external rotation and flexion. Treatment includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic strategies include patient education, activity modification, and structured rehabilitation followed by transition to a long-term home exercise program. Pharmacologic treatment may involve progressively potent oral analgesics and perhaps corticosteroid injections. Surgical procedures, such as shoulder arthroplasty and arthroscopic debridement, are indicated for intractable pain and loss of function.

N2  - Glenohumeral arthritis has traditionally been a disease with a limited arsenal of treatment. Once medical management is no longer effective for pain relief, patients usually are offered a shoulder arthroplasty as the main surgical treatment. This operation is reliable for pain relief, but not as efficient in reestablishing motion to the patient. Moreover, patients with glenohumeral arthritis are often older, and have associated co-morbidities with multiple medical conditions that may be contraindications to a major surgery. A less invasive arthroscopic debridement of patients with severe grade IV glenohumeral arthritis has shown reliable improvements in both pain and function. Isolated arthroscopic debridement is a relatively low risk procedure that relieves pain in nearly 80% of patients with severe glenohumeral arthritis by 3 months, and may provide relief for more than 4 years. It can be considered as a temporizing procedure that may be included in the algorithm of management of patients with severe shoulder arthritis. Copyright © 2004 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Glenohumeral arthritis has many different etiologies, including osteoarthritis, secondary degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, cuff tear arthropathy, and capsulorrhaphy arthropathy. Each of these diagnoses may have different underlying pathoanatomy and pathomechanics. The treating physician must recognize how these characteristics impair shoulder function so that the prescribed course of treatment addresses the root causes of shoulder dysfunction. The patient's age, level of physical activity, and comorbidities should be taken into account, and the intended management should be weighed against how these factors may interfere with treatment efficacy over the long-term. The goal of treatment is to restore comfort, motion, strength, and stability to the shoulder in a safe and reliable manner. Conservative treatments should aim to optimize shoulder flexibility, maintain muscle function, and reduce inflammation. Activity modification is crucial but often unreasonable to the active patient. Temporary surgical approaches include arthroscopic debridement and synovectomy. These approaches may be appropriate for a younger patient with some remaining joint space and a functional rotator cuff. Definitive surgical treatment typically involves either a proximal humerus replacement or a total shoulder replacement. The decision to resurface the glenoid should be based on the patient's age, diagnosis, available bone stock, and physical demands. The surgeon must be familiar with the options provided by the given implant system so that the proper balance of motion and stability can be restored with a close approximation of the native anatomy. In experienced hands, good-to-excellent results can be achieved in greater than 90% of properly selected patients. Glenoid component failure is one of the most common complications of shoulder arthroplasty, highlighting the need to select carefully patients in whom glenoid resurfacing is warranted.

N2  - Patients with a glenohumeral arthritis and a deficient rotator cuff represent a therapeutic challenge. In 1987, Paul M. Grammot, MD introduced a new reverse design to treat this patient population. This reverse design shoulder prosthesis has a cup placed within the proximal humerus and a hemisphere fixated to the glenoid. This prosthetic design relies on the deltoid to provide active elevation. In this issue, Dr Gilles Walch, a leading international expert in shoulder surgery, shares his views on the reverse design prosthesis. Dr Walch has had vast experience and reports a high success rate with the implant, which is currently under IDE study in the United States.

N2  - The humeral head is the second most common site for nontraumatic osteonecrosis after the femoral head, yet it has attracted relatively little attention. Osteonecrosis is associated with many conditions, such as corticosteroid use, sickle-cell disease, alcoholism, dysbarism (or caisson disease), Gaucher's disease, and other systemic conditions. The diagnosis is a clinical and radiographic one, the latter forming the basis for its staging. Treatment depends on the chronicity and severity of symptoms, as well as the degree of clinical and radiographic progression. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic debridement and core decompression for early osteonecrosis and hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty for more advanced disease. This report reviews osteonecrosis of the humeral head, with an emphasis on current treatment options.

N2  - Rheumatoid arthritis is a polyarticular disease of unknown aetiology and joints of the shoulder joint complex are frequently involved. Four radiological patterns of the rheumatoid shoulder have been identified with the wet pattern being associated with early rupture of the rotator cuff. Since local tenderness is a poor guide to the site of the problem and imaging only poorly correlates with the clinical presentation, we frequently employ the injection test for locating the site of pain. The indication for arthroplasty in the rheumatoid shoulder is uncontrolled pain localized to the glenohumeral joint, with loss of function. Humeral head replacement and unconstrained Neer II total arthroplasty are the most frequently reported procedures, with long-term studies showing good or excellent results in over 90% of cases. When there is painful glenohumeral incongruity with adequate glenoid bone stock, an intact rotator cuff and sufficient capsular freeing, a total shoulder arthroplasty is performed. Otherwise, only a humeral head replacement is used. Loosening of the cemented humeral component in rheumatoid shoulders is uncommon and even though radiological loosening of the glenoid component is frequently encountered, it is rarely symptomatic. Glenohumeral arthroplasty can achieve excellent pain relief and functional improvement in the management of rheumatoid shoulders even in the presence of inadequate bone stock and rotator cuff deficiency. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Within the past 100 years, shoulder and elbow surgery has developed into a highly sophisticated specialty. Technical advancements now allow operative treatment of most shoulder and elbow disorders. Shoulder arthroplasty is able to accurately reproduce normal anatomy and function. It is used in degenerative omarthrosis, humeral head fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, and rotator cuff arthropathy. After 10 years, survival of 93% can be expected and in omarthrosis an outcome score of 85 of 100 points. In recurrent shoulder instability, open surgery is still the gold standard. It allows to accurately adjust capsular tension. Modern arthroscopic techniques shorten the capsule with sutures or by capsular shrinkage, but sufficient follow-up is not yet available. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression is the standard procedure for subacromial disorders. The indication for operative rotator cuff closure must be adjusted to the age and functional expectations of the patient. Smaller defects can be closed arthroscopically. The operative technique in proximal humerus fractures is particularly demanding, due to osteoporosis and the risk of avascular necrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging technique at the shoulder, often combined with intravenous or intraarticular contrast injection. Elbow joint replacement is mostly used in rheumatoid arthritis and has achieved a high technical standard.

N2  - Pain following total shoulder arthroplasty or humeral hemiarthroplasty is uncommon: Impingement syndrome can be an infrequent source of pain following shoulder arthroplasty. We retrospectively reviewed six patients with refractory impingement syndrome treated with arthroscopic acromioplasty following either total shoulder arthroplasty (four patients) or humeral hemiarthroplasty (two patients). Chronic impingement syndrome requiring acromioplasty affected 3% of all patients who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty or humeral hemiarthroplasty during the study period. A thorough history, physical examination, and radiographic findings made the clinical diagnosis of impingement syndrome. All six patients had positive impingement signs and a positive impingement test with subacromial lidocaine injection. Preoperative radiographs revealed a type II or III acromion and subacromial outlet narrowing in five of six patients. Other sources of shoulder pain including prosthesis loosening, infection, and rotator cuff tear were ruled out preoperatively by physical examination and radiographic findings, and were confirmed by arthroscopic examination. The results of arthroscopic acromioplasty were a reduction in pain from 7.5 preoperatively to 1.6 postoperatively, on a scale from 0 to 10. Five of six patients were completely satisfied with the results of their arthroscopic surgery. Overall, according to the University of California at Los Angeles end-result score, the results were rated as excellent or good in five patients, and unsatisfactory in one patient. Arthroscopic acromioplasty can be a successful technique for the treatment of chronic impingement syndrome following total shoulder arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty in appropriate patients.

N2  - Humeral head replacement arthroplasty has been performed for more than 40 years. As the technique has been refined and advances have been made in joint arthroplasty of the lower extremity, the indications and success of shoulder arthroplasty have greatly improved. The humeral component in a shoulder arthroplasty can be implanted with either cement or press fit fixation. Both techniques are precise and demand meticulous attention to detail to achieve optimum results for the patient. Press fit fixation, with or without porous coating for biologic ingrowth, can be considered for a patient with good bone stock, if it is felt that a stable interface can be obtained. In patients with abnormal bone, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis who are on corticosteroids and those with osteoporosis, the use of cement can provide stable long-term fixation.

N2  - The most common causes of osteonecrosis of the humeral head are steroid use and trauma. Corticosteroids produce osteonecrosis by alterations in fat metabolism, and trauma, by injury to the anterolateral ascending artery. The need for replacement surgery is influenced by stage and extent of the disease, as well as a history of trauma. Results of replacement are superior in steroid-induced osteonecrosis compared to posttraumatic osteonecrosis.

N2  - Forty-two patients (65 shoulders) with osteonecrosis of the humeral head were reviewed. Minimal follow-up was 2 years or until shoulder arthroplasty was performed for persistent severe pain and disability not responsive to conservative treatment. Thirteen shoulders had surgery shortly after presentation, whereas 22 others initially treated conservatively required surgery. Thirty shoulders in 20 patients have been treated without surgery and were evaluated at an average of 10 years after initial presentation. Fifteen shoulders are doing satisfactorily, whereas 15 others are doing poorly. Overall, 37 (71%) shoulders had clinical progression of disease requiring shoulder arthroplasty or resulting in severe pain and disability. All had radiographic stage III, IV, or V, and 41 (85%) had articular surface incongruity of 2 mm or greater. Humeral head drilling was not effective in preventing clinical or radiographic progression in stage III.disease. Radiographic stages of III or greater and documented radiographic disease progression were significantly associated with a poor outcome.

N2  - Shoulder dysfunction is unusual in osteoarthritis and usually responds to conservative treatment. The primary indication for surgery is pain unresponsive to medical management. The procedure of choice for degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint is hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder replacement depending on the condition of the glenoid. Shoulder fusion is rarely necessary for osteoarthritis and is recommended for chronic infection, flail shoulder, and failed total shoulder replacement not amenable to revision. Joint resection is reserved for infected joints with massive bone loss. The results of shoulder arthroplasty are good to excellent in 86 to 94 per cent of all patients. The results of shoulder arthrodesis are less predictable, but are usually satisfactory in approximately 75 per cent of patients with 10-year follow-up. The treatment of AC and SC joint arthritis is conservative with rest, local heat, and medication. Pain unresponsive to this regimen is an indication for resection of the joint. Good results with this procedure directly correlated with pain relief on injection of the joint with local anesthetic.
