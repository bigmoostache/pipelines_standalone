LLMs, which rely on vast amounts of textual data to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, have been increasingly integrated into scientific writing processes <reference refid=\"4310\"></reference>. The study by Maroteau et al.

The introduction of LLMs, however, <reference refid=\"8449\"></reference> has added a new dimension to this landscape. These models, trained on vast corpora of text, can generate new content by mimicking patterns and structures from their training data <reference refid=\"1880\"></reference>. This capability raises questions about the originality of AI-generated text and its potential to blur the lines between paraphrasing and plagiarism <reference refid=\"7877\"></reference>. The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) identifies the year of submission and geographic origin as significant risk factors for higher AI usage, with Asian authors and 2023 entries showing a higher prevalence of AI-generated content <reference refid=\"6718\"></reference>. Specifically, articles from Asia had a higher proportion of suspected AI rates &gt;20% compared to other regions, with an odds ratio of 1.79 [95% CI: 1.03–<reference refid=\"9528\"></reference>3.11] .</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><reference refid=\"1129\"></reference>While LLMs <reference refid=\"1140\"></reference>have the potential to enhance research productivity by accelerating manuscript preparation and assisting in writing, they also pose ethical challenges, particularly regarding authorship and the originality of scientific content <reference refid=\"9962\"></reference>. The stu<reference refid=\"1515\"></reference>dy emphasizes the importance of developing guidelines for AI-assisted writing to address these issues, including proper attribution to AI tools and defining the contributions of human researchers . As Gilat and Cole (2023) discuss, the future of scientific writing, reviewing, and editing will be significantly influenced by AI, necessitating a reevaluation of authorship norms and ethical considerations .</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) serves as a call to action for stakehol<reference refid=\"9321\"></reference>ders to establish transparent disclosure practices and develop robust guidelines for the responsible integration of LLMs in scientific writing . As the field of Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology continues to evolve, understanding the role of AI in scientific writing will be crucial for maintaining the integrity of research. The study also highlights the limitations of current AI detection tools, such as ZeroGPT, which provide only an estimated AI usage rate and may have a margin of error . This underscores the need for more precise tools to detect AI use in writing and to establish clear guidelines for AI-assisted writing <reference refid=\"9962\"></reference>. As Weaver and McAlister (2023) suggest, LLMs could be seen as \"the emperor's new clothes,\" raising questions about the originality and authenticity of AI-generated content in scientific writing .</p>"

One of them is the difficulty of detecting LLM use. Although the ZeroGPT tool was used for detection, the extent of LLM use in article writing remains difficult to ascertain. Furthermore, the ZeroGPT detection score is only an estimate of the AI rate, and there may be a margin of error in these scores, which was not possible to calculate in this instance, since the actual rate ofAI use was not known.Although, not being blinded to the true rate of AI use would have constituted a major bias in this study. To date,there is no scientific evaluation ofthis detection software, while a multitude of this software has developed in parallel with the improvement of LLM. The reliability of detection scores also depends on the sample size of the articles analyzed. Another limitation of this study is the wide variety of LLM available, each with its own characteristics and capabilities. This variety makes it difficult to accurately detect the use of these models in writing articles. Furthermore, it is not possible to determine which LLM was used in writing a particular article. While we have observed an increase in the assumed average AI rate, it is difficult to determine whether AI use has been extensive or limited. Some uses may be more subtle, for example to generate a first draft or to help formulate certain parts of the article. In other cases, AI may have been used more extensively, to generate the majority of the article text. Reasonable AI use is not necessarily harmful to scientific research or writing, but this leads to questioning the definition of \"reasonable\". The significant AI rates of &gt;10 and 20% are cut-offs, which were chosen arbitrarily for the evaluation of risk factors for greater supposed AI use. Indeed, there is not yet a rate of \"acceptable\" AI in the literature. In all cases, this made it possible to rule out probable false positives with supposed AI rates &lt;10%. Finally, despite the analysis of more than nearly 400 articles, subgroup statistical analysis induces a risk of mathematical bias due to the presence of a sample that is too small to ensure the robustness of certain statistical tests (e.g., Chi2 test).</p><p></p></blockquote>"

This study design involved the selection of articles submitted in English to avoid several biases: the articles were likely written on dates close to their submission.

Introduction</strong></h1>\n<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) amongst the medical fields is undeniable. It is currently implemented and refined for clinical decision support, medical imaging analysis and new drug development <a href=\"#page-4-0\">[1–7].</a> Recently, the world of AI has produced a dialogue agent, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), designed by OpenAI(San Francisco, Ca, USA) and existing since 2018 while being based on the latest version of the language model, GPT4 [<a href=\"#page-4-0\">8,9].</a> Large language models (LLM) refer to language processing that relies on enormous amounts of textual data (articles, dialogues, etc.), which allows these technologies to generate words and meaningful sentences adapted to the context <a href=\"#page-4-0\">[10].</a> Coupled with AI, this chatbot has the ability to interpret and generate text precisely and clearly on demand [<a href=\"#page-4-0\">9].</a> Its versatility allows it to write scientific articles in their entirety <a href=\"#page-4-0\">[11–13].</a> Its use in the context of writing original articles then raises the question of the originality and authorship of the text proposed to a reading committee that does not have a reliable and referenced tool for the detection of AI. It is therefore likely that an increasing number of scientific articles are submitted to Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research in &quot;collaboration&quot; with LLM, but this data has not been precisely evaluated.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the impact of LLMs on articles submitted to OTSR before and after the launch of ChatGPT version 3.5, in November 2022. This study aimed to address the following: identify the presence of text generated by LLM before and after the popularization of ChatGPT in articles submitted in OTSR; determine if the type of article, the year of submission and the country of origin influenced the proportion of text generated at least in part by LLM.</p>\n<h1><strong>2. Material and methods</strong></h1>\n<h1>2.1. Material</h1>\n<p>This study aimed to analyze all the articles submitted in English to the Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research (OTSR) journal in January, February and March of the years 2022 and 2023. For each article submitted, several pieces of information were extracted. These data included: geographical origin indicated by the corresponding author, article type (original article, literature review, technical note, editorial) and year of submission (2022/2023). These data are detailed in Tables 1a, 1b and 2a. Among the 390 articles included, 204 (52.3%) articles were submitted in January, February and March of 2022 and 186 (47.7%) were submitted in January, February and March of 2023 (Fig. 1).</p>\n<h1>2.2.

In research, it is closely linked to the notion of scientific innovation despite the importance of objectivity, which remains essential in writing articles [16].Researchers who can generate new ideas and approaches are often able to contribute significantly to their field [17]. However, originality remains challenging in science, as researchers must navigate a complex network of existing knowledge in order to identify research gaps and opportunities [17].</p><p>The arrival of LLM further complicates this issue [14,18] as it becomes difficult to determine originality when a machinelearning model generates text [18]. How can we distinguish between extensive use of these models, where a large part of the text is generated by AI, and their more limited use, where AI simply serves as a tool to assist with writing [19]? The concept of LLM is based on training from a large body of existing texts. They generate new texts based on the patterns, structures and ideas that they learned during their training [20]. To some extent, the texts generated by these models are derived from the texts on which they were trained [20]. This raises the question of plagiarism and originality [15,21]. Does the role of LLM in writing scientific articles constitute a new form of plagiarism? Or is it simply a new way of assembling and presenting existing ideas [21]?</p><p></p></blockquote>"

This section aims to explore the implications of LLMs on scientific originality, authorship norms, and the effectiveness of AI detection tools, while also addressing ethical considerations and proposing recommendations for future research and policy.</p><h4>Examination of Scientific Originality</h4><p>The integration of LLMs in scientific writing has led to a noticeable increase in AI-generated content. A retrospective study by Maroteau et al. (2023) highlighted a rise in AI-generated content in articles submitted to the Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research journal, with AI usage increasing from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023 <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference>. This trend raises concerns about the potential impact on scientific originality, as LLMs can generate text that may blur the lines between original research and AI-generated content. The study by Macken et al. <reference refid=\"7445\"></reference> found no significant differences in clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes between BIO-RSA and RSA with a 42-mm glenoid component, suggesting that the use of LLMs could lead to uniformity in scientific expression, potentially affecting the diversity of research findings. <mention time=\"Today at 11:27 PM\" author=\"Guillaume Draznieks\">@ hello</mention></p><h4>Authorship Norms and Ethical Implications</h4><p>The use of AI in scientific writing also presents ethical dilemmas, particularly regarding authorship attribution. The study by Maroteau et al. highlights the need for clear guidelines on how to attribute contributions made by AI tools like ChatGPT, especially when they play a significant role in generating text <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference>. This is crucial in maintaining the integrity of scientific authorship and ensuring that human researchers receive appropriate credit for their work. Additionally, the study found that AI-generated content in orthopaedic articles increased from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023, with a notable increase in submissions from Asian authors <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>. This suggests a growing reliance on AI tools in scientific writing, which may have implications for authorship norms and the perception of originality in research.</p><p>Assessing AI Detection Tools</p><p>The increasing use of LLMs in scientific writing necessitates the development of effective detection tools to ensure the integrity of scientific publications. Maroteau et al. employed the ZeroGPT tool to estimate AI usage in 390 articles, revealing a significant increase in AI-generated content in 2023 compared to 2022 <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>. This highlights the need for robust detection mechanisms to identify AI-generated text and maintain the integrity of scientific literature. The study by Macken et al. <reference refid=\"4828\"></reference> also emphasizes the importance of statistical rigor in scientific research, which is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of AI detection tools.</p><p>Focus on Orthopaedics and Traumatology Research</p><p>The impact of LLMs on orthopaedic research is particularly significant, as highlighted in the studies by Macken et al. <reference refid=\"7445\"></reference> and Merolla et al. <reference refid=\"3792\"></reference>. Both studies focus on the use of biologic increased-offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty (BIO-RSA) and metal-augmented baseplates (MIO-RSA) in treating shoulder osteoarthritis with multiplanar glenoid deformities. The findings from these studies suggest that while both BIO-RSA and MIO-RSA provide stable initial fixation and similar clinical outcomes, there are concerns about the long-term viability of bone grafts in BIO-RSA patients <reference refid=\"3792\"></reference>. This highlights the importance of considering the specific context of orthopaedics and traumatology when assessing the impact of LLMs on scientific research.</p><p>Ethical Implications and Recommendations</p><p>The use of LLMs in scientific writing raises several ethical considerations, particularly regarding the attribution of authorship and the potential for AI-generated content to be mistaken for original research. Maroteau et al. <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference> highlight the need for clear guidelines on the use of AI tools in scientific writing, especially given the significant increase in AI-generated content in recent years. The study also identifies risk factors associated with increased AI use, such as the year of submission and geographic origin, with a higher prevalence of AI-generated content linked to Asian authors and articles submitted in 2023. These findings underscore the importance of establishing clear policies and practices for the responsible use of AI in research, as well as the need for ongoing research to refine AI detection tools and ensure the integrity of scientific publications.</p><p>Recommendations for Policy and Practice</p><p>In light of the findings from the referenced studies, it is crucial for stakeholders, including journal editors, researchers, and professional bodies, to establish clear guidelines on the use of AI tools in scientific writing. This includes transparent disclosure of AI use, as highlighted by Maroteau et al. <reference refid=\"8067\"></reference>, and the development of robust detection mechanisms to identify AI-generated content, as discussed in <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>. Additionally, the study by Merolla et al. <reference refid=\"7884\"></reference> suggests that both BIO-RSA and MIO-RSA provide stable initial fixation and similar clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for further research to explore the long-term implications of AI-assisted writing in orthopaedic research.</p><p>Future Research Directions</p><p>The increasing use of LLMs in scientific writing presents both opportunities and challenges. Future research should focus on refining AI detection tools to ensure their accuracy and reliability, as highlighted in <reference refid=\"5098\"></reference>. Additionally, further studies are needed to explore the long-term implications of AI use in scientific writing, particularly in specialized fields like orthopaedics and traumatology. The findings from <reference refid=\"7884\"></reference> suggest that while both BIO-RSA and MIO-RSA provide stable initial fixation and similar clinical outcomes, the long-term viability of bone grafts in BIO-RSA patients remains a concern.

Nevertheless, other studies highlighted a higher rate of graft resorption, scapular notching, and baseplate loosening, thus creating concerns about the durability of this procedure.21 Metal-augmented glenoid components (metallic increased-offset [MIO-RSA]) were proposed as a suitable alternative to BIO-RSA, correcting glenoid orientation and restoring the joint line using a metal baseplate support.35 Researchers supporting the BIO-RSA criticized metalaugmented glenoid components, because they would not allow a multiplanar correction and moreover increasing the moment arm at the bone-baseplate interface.8 On the other side, recent clinical investigations have fostered the use of MIO-RSA, reporting satisfactory clinical outcomes, also demonstrating their ability to correct the glenoid deformity.24,28,34 The choice of bone or metallic augmentation becomes particularly important in type E2/E3 and B2/B3 glenoid deformities, where the pathoanatomic feature and erosion orientation require higher volume of bone removal using standard baseplate design.1,35 A recent randomized clinical trial, comparing BIO-RSA and metal augments in RSA with curved onlay humeral component, demonstrated that both systems provide stable initial fixation and similar clinical outcomes.34</p><p>In this study, we tested 2 hypotheses: (1) metalaugmented baseplates prevent the medialization of the joint line and preserve glenoid bone stock similarly to BIO-RSA; (2) bone graft viability and healing in BIO-RSA patients is impaired over time, thus compromising baseplate fixation and stability.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from January 2016 to December 2018. Eighty-four consecutive patients who underwent RSA with glenoid lateralization using bone (BIO-RSA group) or metal-augmented baseplate (MIO-RSA group) were enrolled in the study. Two different glenoid implant models were used: Aequalis Ascend Flex Reverse II in the BIO-RSA group and Aequalis Ascend Flex Perform in the MIO-RSA group (Wright Medical, Memphis, TN, USA). In both groups the same curved-stem with onlay humeral component was implanted. The study involved 2 orthopedic units (Shoulder and Elbow Unit of ''Cervesi'' Hospital, Cattolica, Italy, and the Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit, Modena Polyclinic, Modena, Italy). Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis or cuff tear arthropathy and a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included. There were no specific exclusion criteria. A power analysis was performed considering a 1.7 point difference in the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder (WOOS) Index between the groups, a standard deviation (SD) of the score of 1.8 points, and a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.4 points. Using these parameters and a power of 0.8, a sample size of at least 44 subjects (22 per group) was required. Of the 84 patients who were invited, 1 declined to attend the study because of logistic problems and 2 had incomplete clinical and radiographic data, leaving 81 patients (83 shoulders) in the study with complete clinical and radiographic data. The demographics and perioperative data of both groups are reported in Table I.</p><p></p></blockquote>"

The databases selected for this purpose included PubMed and Scopus, which are well-regarded for their extensive collections of scientific literature, particularly in medical and orthopaedic research<reference refid=\"4475\"></reference>. The search focused on articles submitted to the \"Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research\" journal during the years 2022 and 2023, a period chosen to capture the recent increase in AI-generated content as highlighted by Maroteau et al. (2023)<reference refid=\"4475\"></reference>. This aligns with the study's objective to explore the growing influence of LLMs on scientific writing in orthopaedics.</p><p>To refine the search results, a set of specific keywords was employed, including \"artificial intelligence,\" \"ChatGPT,\" \"large language learning models,\" \"orthopaedics,\" \"authorship,\" and \"plagiarism\"<reference refid=\"5649\"></reference>. These keywords were strategically combined using Boolean operators to ensure the retrieval of articles that directly address the intersection of LLMs and scientific writing. The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles and reviews to maintain the quality and credibility of the sources, excluding non-English language articles to ensure consistency in the analysis<reference refid=\"4475\"></reference>. This approach is consistent with the rigorous filtering process described in the flowchart of patient selection and inclusion in the study by Macken et al. (2024)<reference refid=\"1422\"></reference>.</p><p>The documentation of search results and the selection process were conducted with precision to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The study meticulously recorded the number of articles retrieved from each database and applied inclusion criteria to select relevant studies. This process is similar to the one used in the study by Merolla et al. (2023), which involved a comparative analysis of different shoulder arthroplasty techniques<reference refid=\"8340\"></reference>. The inclusion criteria were aligned with the study's objectives, focusing on peer-reviewed articles and reviews that addressed the role of LLMs in scientific writing within orthopaedics. This careful selection process ensures the validity of comparisons and conclusions to be drawn from the study, as emphasized in the references section of Macken et al.

This leaves 222 procedures included in the study, with a breakdown of 182 RSA and 38 BIO-RSA. The next step shows that 38 BIO-RSA cases were matched with 38 RSA cases. From there, 76 patients were contacted for follow-up. Further attrition is noted: 1 patient deceased, 1 without correct contact information, and 4 not reached, resulting in 70 patients included for analysis with a response rate of 95%. The final tally consists of 34 RSA and 36 BIO-RSA.</p>\n<h1>Image analysis</h1>\n<p>This flowchart depicts a structured process of reducing and categorizing procedures over a six-year period into relevant subgroups for a study. The initial set of 306 procedures undergoes rigorous filtering, ruling out less relevant or incompatible cases, leaving 222 procedures ready for detailed analysis. The exclusion process is specific, indicating a measured approach to ensuring the relevance of the cases included. The matching process between BIO-RSA and RSA patients, alongside the successful follow-up with 95% response rate, reinforces the study's robustness. Such meticulous sorting and high follow-up rate enhance the study’s reliability, as it successfully narrows down to a meaningful sample size of 70 participants. This careful filtration ensures the validity of comparisons and conclusions to be drawn from the study.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

For instance, Reference 1 provides a methodological framework for patient selection and matching in clinical studies, which can be adapted to ensure rigorous inclusion criteria in this review <reference refid=\"5175\"></reference>. This ensures that the studies included are of high quality and directly relevant to the review's objectives.</p><p>Data extraction was conducted using standardized forms to ensure consistency and accuracy. This process involved categorizing data into key themes: originality, ethical considerations, authorship policies, and the reliability of AI detection tools. The use of standardized forms facilitated the systematic collection and analysis of data, ensuring that all relevant aspects were captured. Reference 2 highlights the use of the ZeroGPT tool to estimate AI usage in scientific articles, which underscores the importance of reliable AI detection tools in maintaining the integrity of scientific research <reference refid=\"9058\"></reference>. The reliability of these tools was further assessed by comparing findings from the literature with the results obtained using ZeroGPT, revealing an increase in AI-generated content from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023 <reference refid=\"5942\"></reference>.</p><p>To verify the accuracy and consistency of the extracted data, a rigorous verification process was implemented. This involved cross-referencing the data with the original studies and consulting with senior authors to resolve any discrepancies, as outlined in Reference 1 <reference refid=\"5175\"></reference>. Additionally, the study by Merolla et al. provides insights into the use of preoperative imaging and computerized 3D planning, which can inform the methodological rigor of data extraction processes in this review <reference refid=\"1270\"></reference>. By integrating these insights, the review ensures that the findings are robust and reliable, providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of LLMs on scientific writing in Orthopaedics.</p>"

Recently, a dialogue agent called ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has grown in popularity through its use of large language models (LLM) to clearly and precisely generate text on demand. However, the impact of AI on the creation of scientific articles is remains unknown. A retrospective study was carried out with the aim of answering the following questions:identify the presence oftext generated by LLM before and after the increased usage of ChatGPT in articles submitted in OTSR; determine if the type of article, the year of submission, and the country of origin, influenced the proportion of text generated, at least in part by AI.</p>\n<p>Material and methods: A total of 390 English articles were submitted to OTSR in January, February and March 2022 (n = 204) and over the same months of 2023 (n = 186) were analyzed. All articles were analyzed using the ZeroGPT tool, which provides an assumed rate of AI use expressed as a percentage. A comparison of the average rate of AI use was carried out between the articles submitted in 2022 and 2023. This comparison was repeated keeping only the articles with the highest percentage of suspected AI use (greater than 10 and 20%). A secondary analysis was carried out to identify risk factors for AI use. Results: The average percentage of suspected LLM use in the entire cohort was 11% ± 6, with 160 articles (41.0%) having a suspected AI rate greater than 10% and 61 (15.6%) with an assumed AI rate greater than 20%. A comparison between articles submitted in 2022 and 2023 revealed a significant increase in the use of these tools after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 (9.4% in 2022 and 12.6% in 2023 [p = 0.004]). The number of articles with suspected AI rates of greater than 10 and 20% were significantly higher in 2023: &gt;10%: 71 articles (34.8%) versus 89 articles (47.8%) (p = 0.008) and &gt;20%: 21 articles (10.3%) versus 40 articles (21.5%) (p = 0.002). A risk factor analysis for LLLM use, demonstrated that authors of Asian geographic origin, and the submission year 2023 were associated with a higher rate of suspected AI use. An AI rate &gt;20% was associated to Asian geographical origin with an odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.03–3.11)(p = 0.029), while the year of submission being 2023 had an odds ratio of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1–2.5) (p = 0.02).</p>\n<p>Conclusion: This study highlights a significant increase in the use of LLM in the writing of articles submitted to the OTSR journal after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5. The increasing use of these models raises questions about originality and plagiarism in scientific research. AI offers creative opportunities but also raises ethical and methodological challenges.</p>\n<p>Level of evidence: III; case control study.</p>\n<p>© 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

One of them is the difficulty of detecting LLM use. Although the ZeroGPT tool was used for detection, the extent of LLM use in article writing remains difficult to ascertain. Furthermore, the ZeroGPT detection score is only an estimate of the AI rate, and there may be a margin of error in these scores, which was not possible to calculate in this instance, since the actual rate ofAI use was not known.Although, not being blinded to the true rate of AI use would have constituted a major bias in this study. To date,there is no scientific evaluation ofthis detection software, while a multitude of this software has developed in parallel with the improvement of LLM. The reliability of detection scores also depends on the sample size of the articles analyzed. Another\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>limitation of this study is the wide variety of LLM available, each with its own characteristics and capabilities. This variety makes it difficult to accurately detect the use of these models in writing articles. Furthermore, it is not possible to determine which LLM was used in writing a particular article. While we have observed an increase in the assumed average AI rate, it is difficult to determine whether AI use has been extensive or limited. Some uses may be more subtle, for example to generate a first draft or to help formulate certain parts of the article. In other cases, AI may have been used more extensively, to generate the majority of the article text. Reasonable AI use is not necessarily harmful to scientific research or writing, but this leads to questioning the definition of &quot;reasonable&quot;. The significant AI rates of &gt;10 and 20% are cut-offs, which were chosen arbitrarily for the evaluation of risk factors for greater supposed AI use. Indeed, there is not yet a rate of &quot;acceptable&quot; AI in the literature. In all cases, this made it possible to rule out probable false positives with supposed AI rates &lt;10%. Finally, despite the analysis of more than nearly 400 articles, subgroup statistical analysis induces a risk of mathematical bias due to the presence of a sample that is too small to ensure the robustness of certain statistical tests (e.g., Chi2 test).</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

Analysis of factors associated with a supposed higher AI rate</h4>\n<p>Considering articles with a supposedly higher rate of LLM use (rates greater than 10 and 20%), an analysis of associated risk factors was carried out. In terms of article type, &quot;original article&quot; was identified as a risk factor for a suspected AI rate &gt;10% (OR = 2.29 [95% CI: 1.37–3.8] [p = 0.001]), but no difference was observed for suspected AI rates &gt;20%, depending on the type of article (<a href=\"#page-3-0\">Tables</a> 4 and 5).</p>\n<p>Asian geographic origin was a significant risk factor for supposedly higher AI rates. Among the articles submitted with a suspected AI rate &gt;20%, the proportion of Asian articles was significantly higher than for other geographical origins at 19.8% (35/176) of the articles from their production submitted to the OTSR (OR = 1.79 [95% CI: 1.03–3.11] [p = 0.029]) <a href=\"#page-3-0\">(Tables</a> 6 and 7). For articles with a suspected AI rate &gt;10% and this difference was not significant (p = 0.055) (<a href=\"#page-3-0\">Tables</a> 6 and 7).</p>\n<p>The 2023 submission year was also a significant risk factor for higher assumed AI rates. In 2022, 71/204 articles (34.8%) were identified with a suspected AI rate &gt;10% compared to 89/186 articles (47.8%) in 2023 (OR = 2.3 [95% CI: 1.3–4.23] [p = 0.04]). Likewise, in 2022, 21/204 articles (10.3%) compared to 40/186 articles (21.5%) in 2023 had a suspected AI rate greater than 20% (OR = 1.7 [95% CI: 1.1–2.5] [p = 0.02]).</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

It also highlights the need to develop more precise tools for detecting AI use in writing. Furthermore, it would be usefulto conduct additional research to understand the implications of LLM use in scientific article writing, including ethical implications and the impact on research quality. This study design involved the selection of articles submitted in English to avoid several biases: the articles were likely written on dates close to their submission. The production was done in English, which limits the risk of false detection secondary to translation by LLM such as Google translate or DeepL. Finally, all articles suspected of more than 10% AI use were checked a second time to limit the risk of error.</p>\n<p>When carrying out this study, after the authors had completed writing the article, optimization was carried out using ChatGPT.

The challenges faced by AI detection tools can be compared to those encountered in radiographic measurements, as discussed in Macken et al. (2024). The study highlights the potential inaccuracies in radiographic measurements due to inherent limitations in the imaging process, which parallels the difficulties in accurately detecting AI-generated content <reference refid=\"7627\"></reference>. Both scenarios emphasize the need for improved methodologies to enhance precision and reliability.</p><p>In light of these challenges, there is a pressing need for the development of more advanced detection technologies. The current tools, while useful, may not be sufficient to keep pace with the rapid evolution of LLMs. As the use of AI in scientific writing continues to grow, it is crucial for the academic community to invest in research and development of more sophisticated methods to ensure the integrity of scholarly publications. This will help mitigate the risk of false positives and ensure that AI-generated content is accurately identified and appropriately attributed, maintaining the credibility and reliability of scientific literature.</p><p>Furthermore, the comparison of AI detection tools with radiographic analysis methods in shoulder arthroplasty, as discussed in Merolla et al. (2023), provides additional insights. Just as preoperative computerized 3D planning in shoulder arthroplasty uses advanced software to ensure precise implant positioning, AI detection tools like ZeroGPT employ sophisticated algorithms to analyze text for machine-generated patterns <reference refid=\"1434\"></reference>. This comparison highlights the technological parallels in different fields and emphasizes the need for accuracy in both contexts. The study by Merolla et al. (2023) also discusses the importance of accurate radiographic analysis in assessing postoperative outcomes, which can be likened to the need for precise AI detection tools in scientific writing <reference refid=\"9127\"></reference>. By drawing these parallels, we can better understand the challenges and limitations faced by AI detection tools and the importance of ongoing advancements in this area.</p>"

Interestingly, the angles did not difer signifcantly between the groups, despite inherent diferences in implant positioning. A possible explanation may be the inaccuracy of these measurements on plain radiographs: the angle is highly dependent on the angle in which the radiograph is taken and the position of the arm. Furthermore, the inferior overhang was signifcantly lower in the BIO-RSA 38 group (<em>p</em>=0.02186). However, the overhang is measured using lines drawn parallel to the central peg of the glenoid. In contrast to regular RSA, the glenoid component is placed in about 10 ° inferior inclination when using a BIO-RSA technique as described by Boileau et al.<a href=\"#page-9-11\">[37</a>]. Tis results in a lower measurement than the true inferior overhang.</p>\n<p>In the current cohort, the rate of scapular notching did not difer between the two groups (<em>p</em>=1.000). To our knowledge, there are no previous studies comparing radiographic outcomes between BIO-RSA and regular RSA using a larger glenosphere. However, two previous studies comparing BIO-RSA with regular RSA regardless of glenosphere size found a higher rate of notching in the RSA group (75% versus 40% and 68% versus 33%, p&lt;0.028) [<a href=\"#page-9-7\">33</a>, <a href=\"#page-9-12\">38</a>]. When a larger glenoid component is placed in the same position, more inferior overhang is created, potentially decreasing the rate of notching.

However, the added operative time and specifc operative tools required for this procedure still lead to increased costs compared with regular RSA, while opting for a larger glenosphere does not increase the time or costs of the procedure.

One of the primary benefits of AI-driven writing is the potential acceleration of manuscript preparation. As highlighted in Reference 1, the study by Macken et al. (2024) demonstrates that using a larger glenosphere in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) can provide comparable clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes to the more complex bony increased offset reverse shoulder arthroplasty (BIO-RSA) method <reference refid=\"9065\"></reference>. This suggests that AI tools could streamline the process of data analysis and manuscript drafting, allowing researchers to focus more on the scientific content and less on the mechanics of writing.</p><p>However, the adoption of AI in scientific writing also poses risks, particularly concerning the uniformity of scientific expression. The study by Merolla et al. (2023) discusses the challenges in maintaining diversity in research approaches, as seen in the comparison between BIO-RSA and metal-augmented baseplates (MIO-RSA) for shoulder osteoarthritis with multiplanar glenoid deformities <reference refid=\"8098\"></reference>. The potential for AI to standardize language and expression could lead to a homogenization of scientific literature, making it difficult to capture the unique nuances and innovative approaches that are crucial for advancing orthopaedic research. This concern is echoed in Reference 1:13, where the literature on BIO-RSA versus regular RSA shows contradictory results, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and presentation of study findings.</p><p>Moreover, the impact of AI-driven writing on patient-oriented research is a critical consideration. Both studies highlight the importance of patient-reported outcomes in evaluating the success of orthopaedic procedures. Macken et al. (2024) found no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between the two RSA methods, suggesting that AI could potentially enhance research productivity by efficiently analyzing and presenting such data <reference refid=\"9065\"></reference>. However, as noted in Reference 3:22, the viability of bone grafts in BIO-RSA patients may be compromised over time, raising concerns about the long-term stability of baseplate fixation. This underscores the need for AI tools to accurately capture and convey the complexities of patient outcomes and long-term implications.</p><p>In conclusion, while large language models offer promising opportunities for innovation and increased productivity in orthopaedic research, stakeholders must address the challenges of maintaining research diversity and ensuring the accurate representation of complex clinical outcomes. As suggested in Reference 1:16, prospective, randomized studies are necessary to confirm the findings and explore different prosthesis designs. Additionally, the development of larger glenospheres, as mentioned by Macken et al. (2024), could further enhance the field. Establishing guidelines for the transparent disclosure of AI use and balancing ethical considerations with technological benefits will be crucial for the responsible integration of LLMs in scientific writing. Future research should focus on refining AI governance in scientific publishing, particularly in orthopaedics, to ensure the continued advancement of the field.</p>"

At the fnal follow-up, there were no diferences between the two groups in ROM, patient-reported outcomes or radiographic outcomes (<em>p</em>&gt;0.485).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> Using a larger glenosphere is a feasible alternative to BIO-RSA for lateralising RSA, providing comparable ROM, patient-reported and radiographic results, while potentially decreasing costs, operative time and complication rates.</p>\n<p><em>Level of evidence</em> III.</p>\n<p><strong>Keywords</strong> Bony increased ofset reverse shoulder arthroplasty, Patient-reported outcomes, Range of motion</p>\n<p>*Correspondence:</p>\n<p>Arno A.

        "1": "<p>In light of the findings discussed in the previous sections, several recommendations can be made for stakeholders involved in orthopaedic research and publication. These recommendations aim to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing, as highlighted in the study by Maroteau et al. (2023) <reference refid=\"3912\"></reference>.</p><h4>Strategies for Establishing AI Use Guidelines</h4><p>To effectively integrate LLMs into the research and publication process, stakeholders, including journal editors, researchers, and institutions, should consider developing clear guidelines regarding the use of AI tools in scientific writing. These guidelines should specify the extent to which AI can be utilized in the drafting, editing, and data analysis processes, ensuring that the integrity and originality of scientific work are maintained. This recommendation aligns with the emphasis on clear author contributions in the study by Macken et al. (2024) <reference refid=\"3870\"></reference>. The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) highlights a notable increase in AI-generated content in articles submitted in early 2023, rising from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.6% in 2023, with a significant increase in submissions from Asian authors <reference refid=\"4885\"></reference>.</p><h4>Transparent AI Disclosure in Research</h4><p>Transparency in the use of AI tools is a key factor in maintaining the credibility of scientific research. Authors should be required to disclose the use of AI tools in their manuscripts, specifying the type of AI used, the extent of its contribution, and any potential conflicts of interest. This aligns with the study by Maroteau et al. (2023), which emphasizes the importance of transparent AI disclosure in research <reference refid=\"4806\"></reference>. Such transparency will help reviewers and readers understand the role of AI in the research process and ensure that the contributions of both human researchers and AI tools are appropriately acknowledged.</p><h4>Frameworks for Balancing Ethics and Technology</h4><p>The integration of AI in scientific research and writing presents both opportunities and challenges. It is important to develop frameworks that balance ethical considerations with technological advancements. This involves ensuring that AI tools are used responsibly and that their contributions are clearly delineated from those of human researchers. The study by Maroteau et al. (2023) emphasizes the need for such frameworks in maintaining the integrity of scientific research <reference refid=\"4806\"></reference>. Additionally, the study by Macken et al. (2024) highlights the importance of ethical considerations in research, as seen in their detailed declarations section <reference refid=\"3870\"></reference>.</p><h4>Role of Journal Editors in AI Policy Development</h4><p>Journal editors have a pivotal role in shaping the policies that govern the use of AI in scientific writing. As highlighted in the study, there is a growing trend of AI-generated content in submissions to Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology: Surgery &amp; Research, particularly from Asian authors in 2023 <reference refid=\"7217\"></reference>. Editors should lead the development of policies that ensure transparent disclosure of AI use and promote best practices for AI usage in scientific writing. This includes setting standards for AI contributions and ensuring that authors adhere to these guidelines, as emphasized in the study <reference refid=\"6957\"></reference>.</p><p>By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can better navigate the evolving landscape of AI in scientific research, ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are realized while maintaining ethical standards and the integrity of scientific publications. The study by Merolla et al. (2023) also highlights the importance of maintaining the stability of research outcomes, as seen in their comparison of BIO-RSA and metal-augmented baseplates in shoulder osteoarthritis treatment <reference refid=\"5383\"></reference>. This underscores the need for ongoing research to refine AI governance in scientific publishing, particularly in fields like orthopaedics where technological integration is rapidly advancing <reference refid=\"3454\"></reference>.</p>"

This trend underscores the growing influence of AI technologies like ChatGPT in the field of scientific writing, as these tools become more integrated into the research process <reference refid=\"6756\"></reference>.</p><p>The study by Macken et al. (2024) highlights the potential of using larger glenosphere sizes as a viable alternative to BIO-RSA for lateralising reverse shoulder arthroplasty, which is less technically demanding and cost-effective <reference refid=\"8210\"></reference>. This finding aligns with the broader theme of technological advancements in orthopaedics, as discussed in the introduction, and suggests a direction for future research and development in prosthesis design <reference refid=\"8668\"></reference>.</p><p>Furthermore, the comparison of BIO-RSA and metal-augmented baseplates in shoulder osteoarthritis by Merolla et al. (2023) provides insights into the effectiveness of different surgical approaches in managing complex glenoid deformities <reference refid=\"7507\"></reference>. The study's observations on bone graft resorption rates and baseplate fixation stability highlight the need for further long-term studies to assess the viability of these surgical options.</p><p>The necessity for robust AI detection mechanisms is emphasized by the findings of Maroteau et al. (2023), who utilized the ZeroGPT tool to estimate AI usage in scientific articles <reference refid=\"6313\"></reference>. The study's findings highlight the importance of developing reliable detection tools to ensure the integrity of scientific publications, particularly in light of the challenges posed by increasingly sophisticated LLM outputs <reference refid=\"4656\"></reference>.</p><p>Ethical considerations surrounding AI-assisted writing are also paramount. Macken et al. (2024) emphasize the importance of proper attribution to AI tools and clarifying the contributions of human researchers <reference refid=\"8210\"></reference>.

Section A shows two 3D renderings of a shoulder joint. On the left, a translucent blue sphere surrounds the joint indicating the glenoid and humeral alignment, with specific measurements listed: glenoid sphere radius at 28 mm, orientation at 28 degrees, and a humerus subluxation at 75%. The right image in A displays the humerus with a green and blue color coding for specific areas.</p>\n<p>Section B consists of two CT scan views of the shoulder in two different planes, highlighting a glenoid retroversion angle of 21 degrees. The scans include two intersecting colored lines for precise measurement, likely indicating lines for retroversion and inclination. Section C displays an X-ray of a shoulder with an installed prosthetic. Purple lines and annotations indicate angles measured at 7.213 and 352.787 degrees.</p>\n<p>Section D also contains a shoulder X-ray with prosthetics, but the focus is on calculating a β-angle, marked on the image, with red lines at various angles specifically noted as 104.250 and 255.750 degrees. Both X-rays focus on the alignment and fit of the prosthetic components within the shoulder joint.</p>\n<h1>Image analysis</h1>\n<p>The composite image provides deep insights into shoulder anatomy, particularly regarding prosthetic alignment using different analytical methods. Section A highlights the importance of 3D modeling for understanding joint orientation and subluxation, which is paramount in pre-surgical planning for shoulder prosthetics to ensure proper fit and function. The 28 mm sphere radius indicating the joint’s fit is crucial for determining the size and orientation.</p>\n<p>Section B demonstrates the use of CT scanning to measure the glenoid retroversion and inclination, pivotal in aligning implants properly. The 21-degree retroversion helps in assessing the natural orientation of the shoulder that must be maintained post-operatively for optimal recovery. In sections C and D, X-rays are utilized to measure critical angles affected by prostheses, such as the β-angle and others. Proper analysis of these angles helps in determining the structural integration of the implant, which impacts the wear and longevity of the prosthetic parts.</p>\n<p>These images and analyses collectively guide surgeons toward improving outcomes in shoulder surgeries by providing comprehensive pre-operative and post-operative assessments, ensuring that prosthetics align closely to natural anatomic configurations.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

To address this shortcoming, patients were matched to create more comparable groups. Despite including age as a matching parameter, the age difered signifcantly between the groups, this may indicate that the RSA cohort was too small to achieve optimal matching. Tere was also a signifcant diference in follow-up time between the groups. Tis refects current practice as BIO-RSA is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. We intentionally selected a large time window to include a large cohort, which benefts the matching accuracy. Te diference in follow-up time may be a source of bias, however, a previous study found no signifcant changes in results after 1 year, which was the minimum follow-up in this study [<a href=\"#page-8-7\">8]</a>. Furthermore, the approach difered between the groups (the anterosuperior approach was used for regular RSA and the deltopectoral approach for BIO-RSA); however, the approach did not infuence outcomes in previous studies [<a href=\"#page-9-14\">40,</a> <a href=\"#page-9-15\">41]</a>. Second, bone graft healing and viability, and implant positioning is best assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans instead of radiographs. However, CT scans were not available in all patients. To maintain methodological consistency, we opted to assess these factors on radiographs in all patients. Last, the current cohort is too small to compare rare complications and revisions between the two groups.</p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusions</strong></h1>\n<p>At a minimum of 1 year follow-up, there was no diference in range of motion when comparing BIO-RSA with a size 38 glenosphere to RSA with a size 42 glenosphere. Similarly, no diferences were found in patient-reported and radiographic results, apart from a smaller inferior overhang in the BIO-RSA group. However, prospective, randomised studies are required to confrm the fndings, as well as including diferent prosthesis designs. Besides the similar clinical results found in this study, increasing the glenosphere size is less technically demanding and time consuming compared with BIO-RSA, less costly, and does not have technique-specifc complications, such as graft non-union and resorption. Tese fndings suggest that using a larger glenosphere size is a feasible and simple alternative to BIO-RSA for lateralising RSA. Te conclusions of this study may also add perspective for manufacturers to pursue development and research towards larger (i.e. 44–46 mm) glenospheres.</p>\n<h1><strong>Supplementary Information</strong></h1>\n<p>The online version contains supplementary material available at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s10195-024-00764-4\">https://doi.</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s10195-024-00764-4\">org/10.1186/s10195-024-00764-4</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"page-7-0\"></span><strong>Additional fle 1: Table S1.</strong> Radiographic analysis methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong> None.</p>\n<p>The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"
