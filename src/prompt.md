	#### What is already known?
	
	There is no published study with a mean 4-year follow-up comparing the functional outcome between Laterjet and arthroscopic assisted iliac bone graft in management of glenoid deficiency, with scarcity of the studies comparing both techniques.
	
	### What are the new findings?
	
	To our knowledge this the first comparative study with a mean 4 year follow-up reporting the clinical outcome and the complication rate of both techniques. There was statistically significant improvement in Constant and UCLA score of both methods at the last follow-up. We did not find statistically significant difference in the clinical outcomes between both, but the complication rate is smaller in Laterjet treatment group.

	#### Introduction 
	
	Recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability is usually related to disruption of the anteroinferior labrum, "Bankart tear"; however, patients with recurrent instability of the glenohumeral joint have glenoid defect [\[1,](#page-5-0)[2\]](#page-5-1). 
	
	The integrity of the bony arc of the glenoid is the most crucial factor related to the success of the surgical repair. Glenoid bone injury may affect the stability of the glenohumeral joint, leading to further dislocation or subluxation [[3](#page-5-2)]. 
	
	Preoperative radiology is important for the diagnosis and estimation of bony defects in patients with recurrent instability. The apical oblique and West Point views are essential radiographs for assessing glenoid bone defects. If any bony injury is suspected, computed tomography (CT) can provide important data about the size of the bone defect. Additionally, three-dimensional reconstruction CT with digital subtraction of the humeral head provides an en face sagittal view of the glenoid, allowing accurate measurements of the percentage of the glenoid bone defect [[4](#page-5-3)]. 
	
	The most popular option for anterior glenoid defect (20%) in recurrent shoulder dislocation is the coracoid transfer (Laterjet). Eden–Hybinette used a tricortical iliac bone graft for larger glenoid defects with an irreparable capsular-ligamentous structure that may not be completely restored in coracoid transfer and after the failure of Laterjet surgeries [[5](#page-5-4)]. With the development of arthroscopic techniques, iliac bone block grafting can be assisted arthroscopically [\[6\]](#page-5-5). 
	
	Few published studies compared the clinical outcomes of both techniques. They concluded that both were effective and reliable, with no consensus on the superiority of one technique over the other [\[7](#page-6-0)]. This study aims to assess the clinical outcome using Constant and UCLA scores and report the complication rates of Latarjet and arthroscopic-assisted iliac crest bone graft transfer (ICBG) in anterior shoulder instability with the glenoid bone loss with a mean 4-year follow-up. The study hypothesis was that both techniques had satisfactory clinical results, but the Laterjet procedure is better with respect to the complication rate.

	#### Mini-open laterjet procedure 
	In this study, the procedure was performed through a deltopectoral approach. The tissue was dissected in the subcutaneous plane bluntly; then, the clavipectoral fascia was opened along the incision line. The cephalic vein was freed and moved laterally; then, the interval between the deltoid and pectoralis major was opened. Shoulder abduction and external rotation (ER) were performed to identify the coracoacromial ligament and then transected 1 cm from its insertion into the coracoid process. Then, the shoulder joint was placed in adduction and internal rotation (IR) to identify the pectoralis minor, and its tendon was released sharply from the medial aspect of the coracoid process with a periosteal elevator. The musculocutaneous nerve was recognized and secured with digital palpation during the coracoid exposure. Then, multiple drills with smooth wires on their superior surface were applied, followed by a saw. Then, osteotome was used to remove the coracoid bone graft from the medial to lateral anterior to the coracoclavicular ligament, which is attached to the base of the coracoid. The harvested bone graft was debrided from any remaining tissue, using the burr to prepare the undersurface of the bone for transfer. The shoulder was placed in the lateral rotation to visualize the subscapularis and then identify the upper and lower borders of the subscapularis. A transverse subscapularis division between the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds was performed. A longitudinal capsulotomy was performed. The glenoid labrum was dissected subperiosteally at the anterior-inferior part using electrocautery to expose the anterior part of the neck of the glenoid and then the burr to prepare the bed for transfer of the coracoid. The retractor was positioned in the joint to move the humeral head away to allow better visualization of the vertical graft position along the glenoid rim, just flushed with the articular cartilage at a position between 3 and 5 o'clock. Two lag 4.0-mm cannulated screws were used to fix the graft 1 cm apart [(Fig. 2](#page-2-0)). 
	
	Capsular repair allows the transferred coracoid graft to function as an extra-articular platform and protects the humeral head articular cartilage from the bone block's abrasive effects. The CA ligament stump was sutured to the capsule for enforcement. Then the split of the subscapularis was repaired with a high-strength No. 2 Fiber wire suture. The wound was stitched in layers.

	#### Arthroscopic reconstruction of the glenoid by tricortical ICBG transfer
	
	Routine diagnostic arthroscopy was the first step to assess the pathology and detect any concomitant glenohumeral lesions. The working anterosuperior portal was formed proximal to the subscapularis muscle using an outside-in technique. Then, the deep anteroinferior portal was
	
	<span id="page-2-0"></span>![_page_2_Picture_7.jpeg](https://lucario.deepdocs.net/files?file=fb29a5bf-2829-4164-85f2-8ed03c6d6eaf_20250313001353.jpeg)
	
	Fig. 2. The coracoid process is fixed to the anteroinferior part of the glenoid with two cannulated 4-mm screws.
	
	6–7 cm distal to the anterosuperior portal pointing toward the anteroinferior aspect of the glenoid; then, the capsulolabral complex was released from the scapular neck until a red fleshy fibre of the subscapularis is seen (create space for insertion the graft), and the glenoid neck was prepared using a motorized burr to make a smooth surface and enhance healing of the graft with the release of the rotator with adequate interval to facilitate the passage of the graft.
	
	Then, a guidewire was passed from the anterior glenoid rim (subchondral and at the anteroinferior part, which is preferred to insert the graft) posteriorly under arthroscopic guidance. Then, Ethibond no. 5 was passed on the guide from the anterior to posterior areas; then, an ipsilateral tricortical iliac bone graft was harvested. The width and length of the graft relied on the dimensions of the defect. Then, a drill hole was made, and Ethibond no. 5 was passed through it [(Fig. 3A](#page-3-0)). A loop in the Ethibond was passed in the glenoid and used to guide the insertion of the graft in its anatomical site in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid. Then, its position was confirmed, and the surface of the glenoid was flushed. Then, through the deep anteroinferior portal, preliminary fixation of the graft was performed with a guidewire, followed by fixation of the graft with two 4-mm cannulated screws ([Fig. 3](#page-3-0)B and C), the position of the screws under C arm guidance.
	
	#### Postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up
	
	The patients continued intravenous antibiotic for 48 h postoperatively. Stitches were removed after 14 days. The patients were restricted to the following postoperative rehabilitation program:
	
	Phase I (weeks 1–3): The patient wore an arm sling and started a passive and active-assisted range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder in the plane of the scapula along with elbow, wrist and fingers motion.
	
	Phase II (weeks 4–5): The patient removed the sling, with passive IR increased to 45 and ER from 0 to 45.
	
	Late Phase II (weeks 6–9): Passive forward elevation and abduction along with IR and ER were continued. Active ROM can be increased, with the strengthening of the scapular muscles.
	
	Phase III (weeks 10–15): Biceps and pectoralis major, minor, and subscapularis are strengthened. Full shoulder motion should be achieved before advancing to phase IV.
	
	Phase IV (weeks >16): Return to previous activity before injury [[9](#page-6-2)].
	
	The primary outcome was to compare the preoperative and postoperative Constant [[10\]](#page-6-3) and UCLA [\[11](#page-6-4)] scores within each treatment group. Comparing the functional scores (Constant and UCLA), complication rate, radiological assessment, ROM and the return to the previous activity level between both techniques was set as the secondary outcome. The patients were followed radiologically using radiography and CT to confirm the union of bone graft, screw position, and graft survival at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The final postoperative primary and secondary outcomes were documented in both groups with a minimum 38 months follow up period in the coracoid transfer group and 36 months in iliac bone graft.

	#### Results 
	
	This prospective study presented fifty patients with a recurrent shoulder dislocation and anterior glenoid defects. Twenty-five patients were candidate for Laterjet reconstruction, and 25 patients for ICBG. There was no significant difference found between the two groups regarding mean age, sex, glenoid bone loss, affected side, preoperative overhead activity level and follow-up duration ([Table 1)](#page-3-1). 
	
	The mean number of dislocations in Laterjet was 7.7 1.5 with a mean of 2.3 0.9 years from the first dislocation to operation while it was 8.2 1.6 with a mean of 2.1 0.7 years from the first dislocation to operation in ICBG with no evidence of a statistical difference between both treatment groups (p ¼ 0.14). Seven off-track Hill-Sachs lesions were discovered intra-operative in both groups. All of them became on-track at the end of surgeries. 
	
	This study showed statistically significant improvement in the preoperative ROM at the completion of follow-up in each group ([Table 2)](#page-4-0). There was no statistical difference between both groups in the final forward flexion, abduction, ER, and IR. Although the ICBG group had better final postoperative IR than the Laterjet group, the results were not statistically significant between the groups ([Table 2)](#page-4-0). 
	
	The Constant and UCLA scores had statistical improvement in both groups at the end of follow-up (p ˂ 0.00001) ([Table 2)](#page-4-0). The last postoperative follow-up scores in both groups were compared and did not show a statistical difference [(Table 2](#page-4-0)). At the end of the follow-up, all patients returned to their pre-injury activity level except one patient in Laterjet group. 
	
	The final radiological follow-up for both groups revealed graft incorporation and viability in 25 patients for Laterjet versus 23 patients for ICBG [(Fig. 4](#page-4-1)A and B). Only two patients showed graft resorption in the ICBG group ([Fig. 4](#page-4-1)C). 
	
	A smaller complication rate was observed in the Laterjet group with no statistical difference between both techniques (P ¼ 0.09). Regarding the reported complications in the Laterjet group, one patient (4%) had secondary instability due to uncontrolled convulsion and was treated with an iliac bone graft. In the ICBG group, six patients (24%)

	#### Discussion 
	
	The important finding in this study is the statistically significant improvement of the Constant score from 51 5.5 preoperative to 90.2 4.6 postoperative in Laterjet, and from 53.6 6.04 to 89 5.01 in ICBG. Also, the preoperative UCLA score improved from 14.2 3.3 to 31.1 2.1 postoperative in Laterjet, and from 15.4 3.1 to 30.2 2.2 in ICBG, with no evidence of a difference between them at the end of followup. The complication rate among the Laterjet group (4%) was lower than ICBG (24%). The hypothesis of our study is confirmed. 
	
	Because this trial is the first to consider a mean 4-year post-operative follow-up, the sparsely available 2-year follow-up comparative trial and case series were considered for comparison [[7](#page-6-0)]. 
	
	<span id="page-4-1"></span>Recurrent anterior instability of the shoulder joint is a major problem 
	
	in young athletic patients [\[15](#page-6-8)]. Disturbance of the static and dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder joint leads to various grades of instability. Joint conformity, intraarticular negative pressure, glenoid labrum and ligaments, specifically the anterior and posterior bands of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, had a major role in shoulder instability [\[16](#page-6-9)]. The rotator cuff and scapular muscles are dynamic restraints for joint stability [[16\]](#page-6-9). The presence of bony defects increases the risk of recurrence. An engaging bony lesion had been explained by the concept of glenoid track in high-risk patients [[17\]](#page-6-10). Burkhart and De Beer [[18](#page-6-11)] reported 67% of recurrence after arthroscopic soft tissue repair alone in patients with significant glenoid loss, compared with just 4% in those without it. Glenoid and humeral bony defects or bipolar bone defects raised concerns among orthopaedic surgeons. 
	
	Latarjet surgery is the most widely used procedure as it provides a triple-blocking effect to support anterior shoulder instability. First, the coracoid transfer to the glenoid rim increases the surface area of the glenoid safe arc. Second, the conjoined tendon reinforces the anterior capsule, preventing forward translation of the humeral head when the

	arm is abducted and externally rotated (sling effect). Finally, the bumper effect of the anterior capsule and glenoid labrum is restored [\[19](#page-6-12)]. 
	
	Iliac bone graft techniques become an alternative for previous failed Latarjet procedures. Iliac bone graft reconstruction is biomechanically less valuable than coracoid transfer techniques because of the lack of a sling effect. However, iliac crest grafts have effectively been used to rebuild the stability in high-risk patients and as a revision technique after failed Bristow–Latarjet procedures [\[20](#page-6-13)[,21](#page-6-14)]. 
	
	Regarding ROM, the results were comparable to those of Kraus et al. [[22\]](#page-6-15). They did not report statistical differences in postoperative ROM compared to the contralateral side. Their final forward flexion, abduction, and ER were 177, 174 and 70, respectively. Additionally, Anderl et al. [\[23](#page-6-16)] stated that the ROM improved significantly as matched to the preoperative values. Full abduction and ER had been reached after surgery as stated by Bockmann et al. [\[24](#page-6-17)]. Moreover, Zhao et al. [\[25](#page-6-18)] observed that almost all patients of their series had normal ultimate postoperative ROM. This study revealed a final mean IR in the ICBG which was comparable to the results of Moroder et al. [[7](#page-6-0)], except that there was a statistically significant difference between both treatment groups in their results. The longer follow-up period and rehabilitation may be an explanation for this finding. 
	
	The UCLA score in the Latarjet group showed improvement with a postoperative score of 31.1 2.1. This is close to the result of Castricin et al. [\[26](#page-6-19)] (32.5 2 in 44 patients) and lower than the result of Krajcsovics et al. [[27\]](#page-6-20) (33.30 points in 32 patients). The Constant score in the coracoid transfer group showed improvement from 51 5.5 to 90.2 4.6. This is comparable to the result of Ersen et al. [[13\]](#page-6-6) in 31 patients (from 55.7 preoperatively to 91.7 postoperatively). The Constant score in the ICBG group was close to the results of Russo et al. [\[14](#page-6-7)] (89 5.01 vs 88.9). The UCLA score in the ICBG group was improved at the end of the study (30.2 2.2). The ultimate result was consistent with Russo et al. [[14\]](#page-6-7) (31.5 in 19 patients) and slightly inferior to the result of Choke et al. [\[28\]](#page-6-21) (32.14 in seven patients).

	Postoperative stability was assessed. No dislocation or subluxation was recorded, except for one patient (4%) in the laterjet group who had an episode of dislocation because of the non-compliance with the antiepileptic regimen. The patient was treated with iliac bone graft transfer. This signifies the long-term results of previous case series that revealed a high rate of stabilization of both methods. Allain et al. [\[29](#page-6-22)] reported no recurrent dislocation but found subjective subluxation in one (2%) patient, while Moroder et al. [\[7\]](#page-6-0) reported a postoperative traumatic recurrence rate in three of 60 patients (5%). 
	
	Medialization of the graft was recorded in two patients <3 mm with no evidence of arthritis. This is lesser than those reported in the literature by Allain et al. (35.7%) [\[29](#page-6-22)] owing to the use of a humeral head retractor against the posterior rim of the glenoid for better visualization and accurate positioning of the graft. Three patients in the ICBG group developed donor site infection. Two patients had only superficial infections that required only antibiotics and dressing, and one patient had a deep infection that needed debridement and daily dressing until improvement. There was partial graft resorption in two patients in the iliac bone graft group without a deleterious effect on the shoulder stability. Russo et al. [[14\]](#page-6-7) recorded (10/19) (52.6%) complete resorption of cortical iliac allografts in their series. Better graft incorporation and lower resorption rate (8%) were observed in this study because of using autogenous iliac bone grafts. Choke et al. [[28\]](#page-6-21) reported complete autogenous iliac bone graft incorporation without graft resorption, but their series had a small number of patients (7 patients). One patient (4%) in the ICBG group had screw prominence with persistent pain which was removed after the complete union. In a study by Michael-Alexander et al. [[30\]](#page-6-23), 9 (3.9%) of 231 patients complained of problems related to the hardware. Bockmann et al. [\[24](#page-6-17)] reported that 2 of 32 patients (6.3%) had continuous pain over the site of screws due to mechanical irritation. These patients were effectively managed with screw extraction.

	#### Limitation of the study
	
	There are some weak points related to this work. The sample size was small. To increase the confidence in the conclusions, a larger number of patients is needed in the future to give more power to statistical tests through the detection of the small effect size difference between both techniques. Additionally, a longer follow-up duration (more than 5 years) is needed to report the remote complications that may not appear earlier. Arthroscopic-assisted ICBG is technically demanding, which needs stepwise learning. Finally, the lack of randomization is also another weak point of this clinical trial.
	
	#### Conclusion
	
	Latarjet procedure and arthroscopic-assisted ICBG had good clinical outcomes of Constant and UCLA shoulder scores in management of anterior glenoid bony defects. The complication rate in Laterjet procedure is lower than ICBG, but the functional results of both techniques were comparable. ICBG has better IR; however, this difference is not statistically significant between both groups. ICBG is recommended as an option for secondary instability after failed Latarjet procedure or large glenoid loss, which needs a large bone block. Glenohumeral arthritis was not recorded during the follow-up period. More comparative long-term trials (˃5 years) will be needed to prove the superiority of either technique.

	Background: In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90-day complication rates following the Latarjet procedure. Data from 2015 were collected from multiple hospitals in the Netherlands, with different volumes of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. 
	
	Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 13 hospitals between 2015 and 2022. Data regarding complications within 90 days of Latarjet procedures were extracted. The effect of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time on the complication rate was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. 
	
	Results: Of the 532 included patients, 58 (10.9%) had complications. The most common complications were material failure (n ¼ 19, 3.6%) and nerve injury (n ¼ 13, 2.4%). The risk of complications was lower for male patients than for female patients (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77; P ¼ .006). Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time were not associated with complications.

	Conclusion: The 90-day complication rate after the Latarjet procedure was 10.9% and was higher in female patients than in male patients. Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time did not affect complication rates. We advise setting up a national registry to prevent under-reporting of complications.

	For anterior shoulder instability, bony procedures (eg, the Latarjet procedure) or soft-tissue procedures (eg, Bankart repair) can be performed.[19](#page-6-0) During Bankart repair, a torn labrum is repaired using sutures and/or anchors, whereas during the Latarjet procedure, the coracoid with its attached tendons is transferred to the anteroinferior part of the glenoid[.12](#page-6-1) The coracoid, as such, acts as an anterior buttress, and the conjoined tendon acts as a sling to prevent the shoulder from dislocating[.3](#page-6-2),[14](#page-6-3) In general, the Latarjet procedure results in a lower redislocation rate compared with arthroscopic Bankart repair (2.7% vs. 15.1%, P < .001) but a higher complication rate (9.4% vs. 0%, P ¼ .002)[.16](#page-6-4) Complications such as nerve injury, infection, hematoma, screw failure (migration, bending, or breakage), and bony nonunion are frequently encountered after the Latarjet procedure[.8](#page-6-5),[13](#page-6-6) Although the complication rate of the Latarjet procedure is higher, there are not significantly more complications requiring revision compared with arthroscopic Bankart repair (5.0% vs. 3.1%).[1](#page-6-7) Previous reports have shown that factors associated with complications after the Latarjet procedure include smoking[,2](#page-6-8) increased age,[7](#page-6-9)[,18](#page-6-10) workers' compensation claim,[18](#page-6-10) surgeon experience,[5](#page-6-11) and use of 4.0- and 4.5-mm cannulated screws instead of 3.5-mm cortical screws.[18](#page-6-10) 
	
	Most complication rates are reported for a longer term (ie, 30 days-316 months) after the operation.[2,](#page-6-8)[6](#page-6-12)[,7,](#page-6-9)[9-11](#page-6-13)[,17,](#page-6-14)[18](#page-6-10) Regarding the short-term complication rate, the literature is scarce. We found only 4 studies evaluating a total of 914 cases assessing the complication rate 90 days after the Latarjet procedure and 1 study assessing the 30-day complication rate in 163 patients ([Table I)](#page-2-0).[2](#page-6-8)[,6](#page-6-12),[10](#page-6-15)[,11,](#page-6-16)[17](#page-6-14) Furthermore, there is a growing trend toward centralization in orthopedic surgery resulting in high-volume hospitals. An example of a program facilitating centralization is the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) program in the United Kingdom. Therefore, most studies assessing complication rates include data from high-volume hospitals. In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90 day complication rates of Latarjet procedures performed in multiple hospitals in the Netherlands from 2015. Each hospital performed a different volume of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. Our hypothesis was that the 90-day complication rate in Dutch hospitals with different volumes would be higher than the rates reported in the literature at high-volume centers summarized in [Table I](#page-2-0) (>4%-9%). Our secondary hypothesis was that several patient and surgical factors (ie, sex, age, body mass index [BMI], smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time) might affect the risk of complications.

	## Methods
	
	This was a multicenter retrospective study. This study has been reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guidelines (Supplementary Appendix S1).
	
	#### Patient selection and data acquisition 
	
	Sixteen surgeons from the Dutch Shoulder and Elbow Society were recruited to share data on Latarjet procedures and complications in their hospitals. All surgeons operating on shoulders and elbows in the Netherlands are members of the Dutch Shoulder and Elbow Society. The digital care systems of all collaborating hospitals were scanned for patients who underwent Latarjet procedures between 2015 and the time of data acquisition [(Table II](#page-3-0)). We included operations performed the surgeons who participated in this study, as well as operations performed by surgeons in the same hospitals as the participating surgeons. It is mandatory to

	have complication registries in Dutch hospitals. The complication registries of the corresponding hospitals were collected and screened for complications within 90 days of Latarjet procedures. To ensure that no complication was missed, the records of hospital visits were also screened for complications. 
	
	The Latarjet procedure was defined as a transfer of the coracoid with the conjoined tendon regardless of the fixation method. A complication was defined as any adverse event related to the Latarjet procedure requiring treatment within 90 days of the Latarjet procedure, such as nerve injury, infection, major hematoma, material failure, nonunion, or malunion. A patient with a nerve injury was defined as a patient referred to a neurologist with or without an additional electromyography and/or nerve conduction study. Graft malposition that was discovered after 90 days was also included because malpositioning occurs during the operation. 
	
	A higher-volume hospital was defined as a hospital in which >40 Latarjet procedures were performed between 2015 and 2020. Subsequently, 6 of the 13 hospitals evaluated were classified as higher-volume centers whereas the other 7 were deemed lowervolume centers.
	
	#### Population characteristics
	
	Alongside complication rates, data regarding patient characteristics and surgical characteristics were extracted. Patient characteristics included age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and previous instability surgery. Surgical characteristics included duration of operation and data regarding fixation method: screw or cortical button, number of screws or cortical buttons, and screw diameter. The exclusion criteria were patients who underwent concomitant procedures and/or were lost to follow-up.
	
	#### Rehabilitation
	
	The rehabilitation protocols were analogous in all participating hospitals. A sling was worn for 2-6 weeks postoperatively. Movement was limited to 90 of flexion and abduction and 0 of external rotation for the first 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, active and passive ranges-of-motion exercises were performed. Sport-specific exercises were performed after 3 months.

	#### Statistical analysis
	
	To answer our primary study question, complication rates were calculated and presented descriptively. For our secondary question, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. If observations on the predictor variables were missing, these variables were not included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, screw size was divided into 2 groups: 3.5 mm and >3.5 mm. We also performed backward elimination for the multivariable logistic regression with a P value cutoff of .157[.15](#page-6-22) P < .05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software (version 14; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
	
	## Results
	
	We identified 537 patients who underwent Latarjet procedures. Of these patients, 5 (0.93%) were excluded because no data regarding complications were reported (loss to follow-up owing to further control visits at another hospital after the surgeon left the hospital). The remaining 532 patients were included in the final analysis. Eleven patients underwent arthroscopic Latarjet procedures, whereas all other patients underwent open Latarjet procedures. Demographic characteristics and the number of complications per demographic factor are summarized in [Table III.](#page-4-0) The number of Latarjet procedures performed per hospital varied from 5 to 116. The complication rate per hospital ranged from 2.7% to 25%. The average age at the time of the operation was 29.9 10.1 years. A total of 94 patients (17.7%) were women and 438 (82.3%) were men. In total, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred [(Table IV)](#page-4-1). Of the 8 infections, 1 was superficial, requiring antibiotics, and 7 were deep, requiring a second surgical procedure.
	
	The average age of the patients with complications was 28.9 10.6 years, and the average age of the patients without complications was 30.1 10.0 years. The average BMI was 24.4 5.7 kg/m2 in patients with complications and 20.7 22.4 kg/m2 in patients without complications. The mean operation time was 81.3 39.4 minutes in patients with complications and 80.5 26.9 minutes in patients without complications. All patients underwent 2 screw fixation except for 3 patients who underwent fixation with 1 screw and 2 patients who received 3 screws.

	508 cases were evaluated in the multivariable analysis. Sex was significantly associated with complications, with male patients having a lower risk (odds ratio, 0.40 [95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77]; P ¼ .006). The other variables did not affect complication rates. In addition, after the application of backward elimination, only sex affected complication rates (odds ratio, 0.44 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.83]; P ¼ .011). All outcomes regarding the multivariable analysis are summarized in [Table V.](#page-5-0) The complications among female patients consisted of nerve injury in 6 (6%), material failure in 5 (5%), graft malposition in 3 (3%), recurrent instability in 2 (2%), and tendon irritation in 1 (1%). The complications among male patients comprised nerve injury in 7 (2%), infection in 8 (2%),

	## Discussion 
	
	In our study population, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred within 90 days of the Latarjet procedure. The risk of complications was lower for male patients in comparison to female patients but was not significantly affected by age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time. 
	
	Our results are different from those reported in the existing literature. First, our complication rate is higher than generally reported in the literature: 10.9% vs. 4%-9% [(Table I)](#page-2-0).[2](#page-6-8)[,6,](#page-6-12)[10](#page-6-15)[,11,](#page-6-16)[17](#page-6-14) We presume that this may be related to the participation of hospitals with low volumes of Latarjet surgical procedures. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, we have mandatory complication registries that are monitored yearly by the Dutch government. As a result of such complication registries, the staff of Dutch hospitals has become more focused on reporting complications. This could explain the higher complication rate in our study. However, the multivariable analysis did not reveal an association between higher and lower volumes and the complication rate. We speculate that this may be because of more complex cases being referred to higher-volume centers. These more complex cases could be more difficult to operate on and might be accompanied by more comorbidity or more bone loss, both resulting in a higher complication rate. Another explanation is that we evaluated volumes per hospital and not volumes per surgeon. We considered hospitals to be high-volume hospitals if >40 Latarjet procedures were performed over a 5-year period because surgeons achieve a level of proficiency after 22 open Latarjet procedures and most of the hospitals had 2-3 surgeons operating on shoulder instability patients[.5](#page-6-11) Evaluating volumes per hospital could lead to an overestimation of the

	volumes of Latarjet procedures that are performed per surgeon (eg, in a high-volume hospital with many surgeons performing Latarjet procedures, it could be that surgeons do not perform the Latarjet procedure that often). An alternative could be to assess the effect of the volumes of shoulder instability surgery per surgeon or volumes of shoulder surgery per hospital or surgeon on complication rates. However, we did not have access to these data. Second, in our population, only male sex was associated with a decreased risk of complications. In previous literature, relevant factors affecting complication rates were surgeon experience, smoking, increased age, workers' compensation claim, and screw type and size.[2,](#page-6-8)[7](#page-6-9)[,18](#page-6-10) We do not have an explanation for this discrepancy. We speculate that the fact that male sex was less associated with complications is a result of hyperlaxity (female patients are more prone to have shoulder hyperlaxity, most likely because of higher levels of relaxin) and anatomic differences (female patients have a more oval-shaped glenoid)[.4](#page-6-23) Although the relaxin theory could explain the differences in recurrence rates, it does not provide an explanation for the other differences, (eg, nerve injury). Furthermore, the difference in the sample sizes between male patients and female patients hampers interpretation of the observed difference in complication rates. A more precise estimate of the difference between sexes requires a larger number of female patients. 
	
	These findings add relevant information to the existing literature, in which high-volume hospitals have been overrepresented. This study also includes low-volume hospitals and is the largest original study assessing 90-day complication rates after the Latarjet procedure (532 patients vs. 133-441 patients). 
	
	Our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, owing to the retrospective design of this study, not all potentially relevant variables were available for analysis, such as operation indication, Instability Severity Index Score, amount of bone loss, and postoperative graft positioning. Therefore, it was not possible to explore how these variables affect the incidence and type of complications. Second, despite the substantial number of participating hospitals and patient data, only 58 complications occurred within the 90-day period assessed. This limits the statistical power to demonstrate the influence of potential prognostic variables. Nevertheless, with 58 complications, the power is considered sufficient to detect 3-6 prognostic variables. Therefore, the lack of power does not explain why no variable other than sex was associated with the risk of complications in our study. Third, the BMI of the Dutch patients included in our study is representative of a fairly normal body habitus. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the effect of BMI on complications. Fourth, we cannot exclude the possibility that surgeons with high complication rates may have been less likely to participate. Moreover, complications were potentially missed if a patient did not go back to the same surgeon or hospital. To improve future research and the quality of health care, we are developing a nationwide registry to capture all surgical procedures and complications prospectively.

	Future studies should have a prospective design to ensure that milder complications are not missed. Furthermore, blinding of assessors was not possible because of the retrospective character of our study. The lack of blinding may lead to under-reporting of complications. For example, surgeons could be less prone to report on transient neuropathy owing to its self-limiting character. This issue cannot be solved by questioning patients retrospectively because of potential recall bias. In addition, the effect of complications on patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction should be studied. A milder complication might have an impact on rehabilitation and thus may affect patientreported outcomes and satisfaction. 
	
	Given the popularity of the Latarjet procedure and the growing need for assessment of the potential benefits and  
	
	risks of this operation, it is advisable to set up a registry database comparable to the arthroplasty registry. Registries provide a large amount of essential information regarding outcomes and can be used to adjust the tools and operative techniques needed for better outcomes. By setting up a national registry database, under-reporting of complications can be prevented by collecting data prospectively, and thus, the risks of retrospectively collecting data can be avoided. Furthermore, the long-term complication rates can be registered and analyzed in a national registry. This can improve our understanding of the clinical course after the Latarjet procedure.
	
	## Conclusion
	
	The 90-day complication rate after the Latarjet procedure was 10.9% and was higher in female patients than in male patients. Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time did not affect complication rates. We advise setting up a national registry to prevent under-reporting of complications.

	Background: Several arthroscopic glenoid bone augmentation techniques have been introduced to treat patients affected by anterior shoulder instability associated with critical bone loss. The efficacy of the different arthroscopic bony procedures has not been compared yet. 
	
	Purpose: To compare the recurrence, complication, and reoperation rates of the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) and arthroscopic free bone block (ABB) procedures for anterior shoulder instability. 
	
	Study Design: Meta-analysis and systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. 
	
	Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase to identify clinical studies reporting the outcomes of the AL and ABB procedures. The following search phrases were used: ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Bone Block'' OR ''Bone Graft,'' and ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Glenoid Augmentation'' OR ''Glenoid Reconstruction,'' and ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Latarjet'' OR ''Coracoid Graft'' OR ''Coracoid Transfer.'' Exclusion criteria were\24 months of minimum follow-up, sample size \10 cases, revision after previous glenoid bone grafting, epilepsy, and multidirectional instability. Data regarding the study design, patient characteristics, surgical technique, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. A proportional meta-analysis was conducted to compare the complication, recurrence, and reoperation rates between the 2 groups. Multiple subgroup analyses were performed to analyze the incidence of each complication and assess the weight of different fixation methods (in the whole cohort) or different graft types (in the ABB group). The modified Coleman Methodology Score was used to assess the risk of bias.

	Results: Of 5010 potentially relevant studies, 18 studies regarding the AL procedure (908 cases) and 15 studies regarding the ABB procedure (469 cases) were included. The 2 groups were comparable in age (*P* = .07), sex (*P* = .14), glenoid bone loss (*P* = .14), number of preoperative dislocations (*P* = .62), proportion of primary and revision procedures (*P* = .95), length of follow-up (*P* = .81), modified Coleman Methodology Score (*P* = .21), and level of evidence (*P* = .49). There was no difference in the recurrence (*P* = .88), reoperation (*P* = .79), and complication (*P* = .08) rates. The subgroup analyses showed a higher rate of hardware-related complications for screw fixation compared with flexible fixation (*P* = .01). 
	
	Conclusion: The AL and ABB procedures had similar recurrence, reoperation, and complication rates. Screw fixation of the bone graft was related to an increased risk of complications compared with flexible fixation.

	During the last few years, growing interest in arthroscopic glenoid bone grafting techniques to treat anterior shoulder instability has been observed. The development of these techniques is related to a number of factors. First, different clinical studies have reported a higher recurrence rate and  
	
	worse clinical outcomes after arthroscopic Bankart repair compared with the open Latarjet procedure.29,65 Second, the threshold value for glenoid bone defects considered suitable for soft tissue repair has been progressively reduced.16,50,52 Moreover, the introduction of the ''glenoid track'' concept has highlighted the importance of the humeral location of bone loss in addition to its volume.31,32,49 As such, several surgical techniques have been introduced to improve the results of arthroscopic treatment versus those of the widely used open Latarjet procedure. Humeral Hill-Sachs remplissage,46 subscapularis tenodesis,38 and capsular augmentation with the long head of the biceps tendon15 have all been described to

	improve the results of classic Bankart repair. Unfortunately, these soft tissue procedures often lead to reduced range of motion, higher postoperative pain, and an increased recurrence rate compared with the Latarjet procedure, especially in patients with glenoid bone loss .15%.44,61 
	
	In this context, both the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL)30 and the arthroscopic free bone block (ABB) procedures,41 introduced by different authors in 2007, aim to restore glenohumeral stability by reducing the complication rate of the open Latarjet procedure and enabling the simultaneous treatment of other joint structures. Indeed, the main advantages of arthroscopic bone graft procedures are the reduction of soft tissue iatrogenic damage, the possibility of treating posterior or superior labral tears, and the possibility of treating Hill-Sachs lesions (if off-track, even after the restoration of glenoid bone loss). 
	
	Upon a review of the literature, we found different studies that have compared the results of the open Latarjet procedure and glenoid bone grafting, showing no significant differences in terms of recurrence and clinical outcomes.43 Regarding arthroscopic procedures, there is only 1 retrospective study that has compared the AL and ABB procedures.59 When dealing with case series, it is obvious that some bias toward reporting favorable results should be considered, which is why these studies are often unlikely to have an effect on clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis aiming to identify the best arthroscopic procedure has been published so far. 
	
	The purpose of this systematic review was to compare recurrence, complication, and reoperation rates after the AL and ABB procedures. We hypothesized that no difference would be observed between the 2 treatment groups.
	
	# METHODS
	
	# Registration
	
	The study's protocol was registered online in the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) database (CRD42022368153). This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.34
	
	# Search Strategy
	
	To identify clinical studies investigating the arthroscopic treatment of anterior shoulder instability with either the AL or the ABB procedure, we used a combination of the following keywords for the article search: ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Bone Block'' OR ''Bone Graft,'' ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Glenoid Augmentation'' OR ''Glenoid Reconstruction,'' and ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Latarjet'' OR ''Coracoid Graft'' OR ''Coracoid Transfer.''
	
	# Study Selection
	
	There were 2 reviewers (A.C. and R.G.) who performed an independent literature search in 3 electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. The titles and abstracts were reviewed for all search results, and potentially eligible studies were selected. Results were then cross-checked. In the case of disagreement, a third author (P.M.) was involved until a consensus was reached. Included articles underwent a full-text review. Finally, the reference lists of included articles and review studies were screened for any additional articles that were not identified in the database search.

	# Eligibility Criteria 
	
	The inclusion criteria were longitudinal studies (retrospective and prospective) evaluating the treatment outcomes of the AL or ABB procedure in patients affected by isolated anterior shoulder instability, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, with no limitation concerning the publication date. The exclusion criteria included the following: case reports, expert opinions, previous systematic reviews, letters to the editor, and cadaveric studies; descriptions of surgical techniques without clinical results; studies with \24-month minimum follow-up; studies that included different treatment methods in which data for the AL or

	One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: R.R. has received grants and nonfinancial support from LimaCorporate and nonfinancial support from Smith & Nephew outside the submitted work. AOSSM checks author disclosures against the Open Payments Database (OPD). AOSSM has not conducted an independent investigation on the OPD and disclaims any liability or responsibility relating thereto. 
	
	ABB procedure alone could not be extrapolated; articles with a sample size \10 cases; revision procedures after previous treatment methods including some form of bone management (open or arthroscopic Latarjet, bone block, Eden-Hybinette, etc); cases with an established diagnosis of epilepsy; patients affected by multidirectional instability; and studies with missing data regarding the complication, recurrence, and reoperation rates. For studies by the same author(s) and with potential overlapping, we selected the one with the largest sample size and excluded the others from analysis.
	
	#### Data Extraction
	
	There were 2 reviewers (R.G. and P.M.) who independently extracted relevant data from the included articles and recorded them onto Excel spreadsheets (Version 2007; Microsoft). The 2 Excel files were then matched, with the senior author (A.C.) arbitrating in the case of disagreement. Data extracted included the following: study design, level of evidence, patient characteristics, number of preoperative dislocations, previous instability surgery, type and level of sport, bone loss, preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes, imaging modality, type of graft and fixation technique, return to sport, recurrence of instability after surgery, and complication and reoperation rates.
	
	Regarding complications, we focused on the following: persistent apprehension, hardware-related complications, graft-related complications, glenohumeral arthritis, infections, nerve palsy, and graft malposition. Graft nonunion, complete graft resorption, and graft fracture were all included as graft-related complications. Local pain stimulated by direct pressure over scar tissue, clicking, and screw pullout or breakage were all considered hardwarerelated complications.

	#### Search Results
	
	The flow diagram for studies included is presented in Figure 1. A total of 5010 studies were found through a computer search and manual screening of reference lists across databases. After the removal of duplicates and the application of exclusion criteria, 33 studies (including 35 series of patients) were finally included in this review (19 series of patients treated with the AL procedure§ and 16 series of patients treated with the ABB procedurek , some studies included two series of patients). Overall, 2 studies were comparative including 2 separate cohorts of patients treated with the AL or ABB procedure (1 comparing different methods of fixation for AL and 1 comparing different methods of fixation for ABB), and each cohort was included in our review.
	
	#### Study Characteristics 
	
	Overall, 908 cases underwent the AL procedure, and 469 cases underwent the ABB procedure. Patient characteristics of and preoperative risk factors for recurrence in the 2 groups are reported in Table 1.

	# Surgical Techniques
	
	Some technical differences could be observed within each group (AL and ABB) in this review. In the AL group, coracoid fixation was achieved with 1 screw, 2 screws, or 2 buttons in 20.3% (n = 184), 48.6% (n = 441), and 31.2% (n = 283) of cases, respectively. In the ABB group, the type of graft was autologous, cadaveric, or allogenic (xenograft) in 41.4% (n = 194), 47.1% (n = 221), and 11.5% (n = 54) of cases, respectively. The bone graft was fixed with 2 screws, 4 buttons, suture anchors, or bone impact (J-graft) in 59.7% (n = 280), 20.3% (n = 95), 16.8% (n = 79), and 3.2% (n = 15) of cases, respectively. Surgical times were reported only in 7 studies, and no statistical analysis was performed for this variable.
	
	### Recurrence, Complication, and Reoperation Rates
	
	We did not observe any significant difference in the recurrence (P = .89) and reoperation (P = .81) rates between the 2 groups, even when pooled proportions were compared (P = .88 and P = .79, respectively) (Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3).
	
	The weighted recurrence and reoperation rates were 2.0% in both the AL group and the ABB group. Moreover, no difference was observed between the types of revision procedure performed, with isolated hardware removal (P = .84), open stabilization (P = .35), and arthroscopic stabilization (P = .76) being the more frequent revision procedures reported in both groups. Overall, the rate of complications in the ABB group (25.0%) and the AL group (14.0%) was not significantly different (P = .08) (Table 2 and Figure 4).
	
	Looking at the type of complication, we did not find any difference for persistent positive apprehension (P = .95), hardware-related complications (P = .47), graft-related complications (P = .20), progression of osteoarthritis (P = .24), infections (P = .91), nerve palsy (P = .40), and graft malposition (P = .60) between the 2 groups (Table 3). Total graft resorption was observed in 0.2% and 4.0% of cases in the AL and ABB groups, respectively. Because of the small numbers available, no statistical analysis was performed for this specific type of complication.

	# Subgroup Analysis
	
	No difference could be observed when analyzing the technique of graft fixation (screw vs flexible methods) as an independent variable for the recurrence rate (P = .99), reoperation rate (P = .17), and complication rate (P = .97) (Table 2). However, there was a significantly greater risk of hardware-related complications in patients for whom fixation was achieved using screws (3.6%) compared with flexible methods (0.4%) (P = .01) in the whole cohort (Table 3).
	
	In the ABB group, the type of graft used did not influence the complication rate (Table 2). However, a trend toward a greater incidence of persistent apprehension was observed with an allograft in contrast to an autograft (P = .10) (Table 3).
	
	## DISCUSSION 
	
	The first result of this study was that both the AL and the ABB procedures were safe and effective in the treatment of anterior shoulder instability. Even in cases of critical bone loss, the risk of recurrence of instability after these arthroscopic techniques (2.0% for both AL and ABB) was very similar to what has been reported after the open Latarjet procedure (~4%).20,21

	The comparison between the AL and ABB procedures showed similar rates of recurrence, reoperations, and complications. However, it should be emphasized that the statistical analysis performed to investigate the overall complication rate in the 2 groups led to a P value of .08, which could be interpreted as a potential tendency toward increased complications after the ABB procedure compared with the AL procedure. Interestingly, total graft resorption was reported in 4.0% of cases in the ABB group versus 0.2% in the AL group. Graft resorption after the Latarjet procedure has already been evaluated in previous studies,18,48,64 which confirmed that partial osteolysis is very common (especially in the upper portion of the graft) and highlights the role of mechanical loading of the humeral head on the graft and the vascular supply provided by the conjoint tendon in coracoid healing. For the ABB procedure, graft resorption has been frequently reported, and it was previously associated with the origin of the graft, with

	allografts being held responsible for this phenomenon.7,47 Of note, in this review, the type of graft (autograft or allograft) did not affect the complication rate. Moreover, considering that glenoid bone defects were comparable in the 2 groups, we suggest that the role of the conjoint tendon in graft loading or vascularization should be better investigated in the future. In any case, the clinical consequences of graft resorption are questionable because there is no clear evidence to demonstrate that graft osteolysis has a clinical effect on the patient.17,36 On the other hand, considering the high rate of graft resorption (especially in the ABB group), the prominence of screw heads could irritate soft tissue and the humeral head's cartilage in the long run, causing pain, osteoarthritis, and the need for hardware removal.45,64 
	
	In this study, the reoperation rate after the AL and ABB procedures was similar, with some differences associated with technical details. Several studies investigated, both biomechanically and clinically, the differences between screw and button fixation of the coracoid graft in the Latarjet

	procedure, concluding that, despite stronger fixation provided by screws, no differences in terms of clinical outcomes could be detected between the 2 methods of fixation.9,11,45 In this meta-analysis, hardware-related complications were more frequent in patients treated with screws (3.6%) than in those for whom flexible fixation methods (0.4%) were used (P = .01), independent from the type of surgery performed (AL or ABB). For this reason, we recommend using button fixation to reduce the potential effect of prominent screws, especially in the ABB group. 
	
	Despite the similar outcomes, the ABB procedure has a few theoretical advantages compared with the AL procedure. First, avoiding subscapularis split and coracoid osteotomy generally reduces surgical times and the risk of bleeding and postoperative shoulder hematoma. Second, the absence of the attached conjoint tendon certainly facilitates the correct position of the bone block. Both factors could theoretically reduce the learning curve and facilitate the propagation of the surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the lack of data on surgical times in primary studies

	included in this meta-analysis did not allow us to draw conclusions about this topic. However, a previous study by Moga et al42 reported a shorter learning curve and better graft positioning with the ABB procedure compared with the AL procedure. Of course, potential drawbacks of the ABB procedure, that is, the increased graft-related complication rate, the cost of an allograft, or donor-site morbidity, should be taken into account in the decision making of the clinician. 
	
	When interpreting the results of this review, baseline differences in the sample size and frequency of participation in sports with a high risk of dislocations in the AL and ABB groups should be considered potential sources of bias. With regard to the mean sample size, we believe that the comparison of weighted rates performed using a proportional meta-analytic method and subsequent metaregression might have partially overcome the difference at baseline. The presence of a larger number of patients participating in contact or overhead sports in the AL group could be interpreted by considering 2 factors. First, data on the practice of at-risk sports have been reported less frequently in the ABB group (251 cases [53.5%]) than in the AL group (610 cases [67.2%]). Second, some studies comparing Latarjet and Bankart repair have demonstrated a higher loss of external rotation for the anatomic procedure,27 which is why some authors recommend the Latarjet procedure to treat patients involved in sports requiring a high degree of external rotation.4 This preference could represent a selection bias in our analysis.

Although this probably reflects true heterogeneity in reporting complications (with an effect size of 1%-80%) (see Figure 4), we acknowledge that this should be taken into account to interpret our findings. Last, in this study, we were only able to pool nonrandomized studies, which reduces the strength of our findings. As a matter of fact, of 33 studies, no study was prospective and comparative, which reflects the lack of high-quality studies dealing with the AL and ABB procedures. In this context, we believe that this review may represent a useful overview on the state of the art of these techniques, providing weighted measures about the risk of complications, recurrence, and reoperations after the index procedure. 
	
	#### CONCLUSION
	
	The AL and ABB procedures had similar rates of recurrence, reoperations, and complications. Screw fixation of 
	
	the bone graft was related to an increased risk of complications compared with flexible fixation.

		<p>The comparison between arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures for anterior shoulder instability reveals nuanced differences in recurrence risks, reoperation rates, and complication profiles. Both techniques aim to address shoulder instability, yet they differ in their approach and outcomes. The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, being minimally invasive, is associated with a recurrence rate of 2.0%, which is comparable to the open procedure, suggesting that both techniques are effective in maintaining shoulder stability <reference refid="5883"></reference>. This aligns with findings from Mahmoud et al. (2022), who reported satisfactory long-term stabilization with minimal reoperations in their study of glenoid bone block reconstructions <reference refid="1670"></reference>.</p><p>Reoperation rates are another important factor in evaluating these procedures. The meta-analysis by Cozzolino et al. (2024) indicates that reoperation rates for both arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures are similar, with no significant difference observed between the two (P = .81) <reference refid="5883"></reference>. This finding is corroborated by Alkaduhimi et al. (2022), who reported a 10.9% complication rate in Latarjet procedures, with material failure and nerve injury being common complications, emphasizing the importance of surgical technique and experience <reference refid="7185"></reference>. These results suggest that both procedures offer durable solutions, though the choice may depend on surgeon expertise and patient-specific factors.</p><p>Complication profiles differ notably between the two techniques. The arthroscopic approach is associated with fewer hardware-related complications, as highlighted by Cozzolino et al. (2024), who noted a higher incidence of such issues with screw fixation in open procedures compared to flexible fixation methods used arthroscopically (P = .01) <reference refid="9355"></reference>. The minimally invasive nature of the arthroscopic procedure potentially reduces the risk of complications such as infection and graft malposition, which are more prevalent in open surgeries. Mahmoud et al. (2022) also noted better graft incorporation and lower resorption rates with autogenous iliac bone grafts, which could be advantageous in arthroscopic procedures <reference refid="1670"></reference>.</p><p>The benefits of minimally invasive surgery, such as the arthroscopic Latarjet, include reduced surgical trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. However, the technique is not without its challenges. The steep learning curve and the need for specialized equipment can limit its widespread adoption. Despite these drawbacks, patient satisfaction tends to be high, with many studies reporting favorable outcomes in terms of shoulder function and stability <reference refid="4679"></reference>. The open Latarjet, while more invasive, remains a reliable option, particularly in cases where extensive bone loss or complex instability patterns are present.</p><p>As we transition to the next section, it is important to consider how these findings impact the choice of surgical technique for different patient populations. The decision between arthroscopic and open Latarjet should be guided by patient-specific factors, surgeon expertise, and the clinical context, ensuring optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction. Further exploration of other bone block procedures will provide additional insights into the most effective strategies for managing anterior shoulder instability.</p>
	
		<h3>Comparison of Arthroscopic Latarjet and Alternative Bone Block Procedures</h3>
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 13,
		  "html_expectations": "<p>This subsection explores the differences in surgical time, graft union, and functional recovery among arthroscopic Latarjet, arthroscopic free bone block, and other shoulder stabilization options.</p>"
		}
		-->
		<p>In comparing the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) procedure with alternative bone block techniques such as the arthroscopic free bone block (ABB), several critical factors are evaluated. These include surgical time, graft union rates, functional recovery outcomes, complication profiles, and cost implications. Understanding these differences is essential for both clinicians and patients when choosing the optimal intervention for anterior shoulder instability.</p><p><strong>Surgical Time:</strong> The AL procedure typically requires a longer operative time due to its technical complexity and the precise positioning of the graft. Although data on surgical durations for AL and ABB are limited, some studies <reference refid="6277"></reference> suggest that the ABB procedure may benefit from shorter operative times by avoiding steps such as subscapularis splitting and coracoid osteotomy. This reduction in operative time can also help minimize bleeding and postoperative complications, particularly in high-volume centers <reference refid="9307"></reference>.</p><p><strong>Graft Union:</strong> Successful graft incorporation is crucial for long-term shoulder stability. The AL procedure has demonstrated excellent graft union rates, with reports of 100% incorporation in some series <reference refid="2080"></reference>. In contrast, the ABB procedure may face challenges such as graft resorption; one study noted a 4.0% resorption rate for ABB compared to only 0.2% for AL <reference refid="7185"></reference>. Moreover, the method of graft fixation—whether by screws or flexible fixation—plays a significant role in hardware-related complications <reference refid="9465"></reference>, thereby affecting overall success.</p><p><strong>Functional Recovery:</strong> Both AL and ABB techniques result in improved shoulder function and similar recurrence and reoperation rates <reference refid="9465"></reference>. However, some evidence suggests that the AL procedure may offer a lower complication rate, with reported figures as low as 4% compared to higher rates (up to 24-25%) observed with certain ABB approaches <reference refid="7439"></reference><reference refid="2446"></reference>. Variability in these outcomes further underscores the influence of surgical volume and individual expertise <reference refid="4860"></reference>.</p><p><strong>Cost Implications:</strong> Although direct cost data are scarce, the potential for reduced operative times and fewer complications with the AL procedure may translate into overall economic benefits. Establishing a national registry, as suggested in some studies <reference refid="4703"></reference>, could provide valuable insights into the cost-effectiveness of these techniques across different healthcare settings.</p><p>In summary, while both the AL and ABB procedures are effective in managing anterior shoulder instability, the AL procedure may offer advantages in terms of superior graft union and a lower risk of hardware-related complications. The decision between these techniques should consider patient-specific factors such as the extent of bone loss, activity level, and surgeon expertise.</p>
	
		<h3>Clinical Evidence Synthesis and Its Role in Guiding Surgical Decision-Making</h3>
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 14,
		  "html_expectations": "This subsection synthesizes findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and registries. It emphasizes consistency or variability in results and highlights the clinical implications of these comparative data."
		}
		-->
		<p>The body of clinical evidence on the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) procedure is extensive, providing a robust framework for evaluating its efficacy and safety in managing anterior shoulder instability. By synthesizing data from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and registry studies, clinicians gain insights such as a 90-day complication rate of approximately 10.9%—with issues like material failure and nerve injury predominating. Notably, gender differences have emerged, as female patients tend to experience higher complication rates, highlighting the need to tailor treatment strategies to individual patient profiles.</p><p>Comparative analyses between the AL procedure and arthroscopic free bone block (ABB) techniques reveal similar recurrence, complication, and reoperation rates of around 2.0%, mirroring outcomes seen in open Latarjet procedures. However, a higher incidence of hardware-related complications with screw fixation—as opposed to flexible fixation methods—underscores the importance of choosing the optimal fixation technique. This evidence-driven comparison serves the purpose of refining surgical practices and improving patient outcomes.</p><p>Data extracted from clinical registries further validate these findings by demonstrating consistency across diverse patient populations and surgical settings. The comprehensive review process, which includes the use of the modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS) to gauge study quality, reinforces the reliability of the evidence. Despite some variability in the measurement of preoperative bone loss and in the reporting of patient-reported outcomes, these differences emphasize the scope for future standardization in outcome assessment.</p><p>Ultimately, this synthesis not only consolidates current clinical insights but also serves the dual purpose of guiding surgical decision-making and identifying areas for further research. By integrating key outcome measures with patient-specific factors—such as demographic characteristics and fixation methods—the evidence offers a clear rationale for selecting the most appropriate surgical strategy. Enhanced standardization and long-term data collection will only strengthen the reliability of these findings, ensuring that the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure remains a dependable option for addressing anterior shoulder instability.</p>

		  "html_expectations": "This subsection outlines standard rehabilitation protocols, focusing on sling use, progressive mobilization, and criteria-based functional exercises specific to overhead and contact athletes."
		}
		-->
		<p>Postoperative rehabilitation following the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure is a structured process designed to optimize recovery and facilitate a return to sport. The rehabilitation protocol is typically divided into several phases, each with specific goals and exercises tailored to the patient's progress. Initially, patients are advised to use a sling for immobilization, which helps protect the surgical site and reduce pain during the early recovery period. The use of a sling is generally recommended for the first three weeks post-surgery, as outlined in <reference refid="8210"></reference>, to allow for initial healing and to prevent undue stress on the shoulder.</p><p>Progressive mobilization techniques are introduced gradually, starting with passive and active-assisted range of motion (ROM) exercises. These exercises aim to restore shoulder mobility while minimizing the risk of complications. According to <reference refid="8210"></reference>, passive forward elevation and abduction are encouraged, with a focus on increasing internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) as the patient progresses. By weeks four to five, patients typically transition out of the sling and begin more active ROM exercises, with a target of achieving 45 degrees of passive IR and ER. This aligns with findings from <reference refid="1992"></reference>, which emphasize the importance of a structured rehabilitation program to minimize complications and optimize outcomes.</p><p></p><img src="https://lucario.deepdocs.net/files?file=44df4f0a-2453-4070-8956-8ed5d83ec1a2_20250317095151.png" style="width: 376px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;" draggable="true"><p></p><p>Criteria-based functional exercises are vital for athletes, particularly those involved in overhead and contact sports. These exercises are designed to enhance shoulder stability and strength, preparing the athlete for a safe return to their sport. Specific exercises for overhead athletes, such as those involved in handball or volleyball, focus on strengthening the scapular muscles and improving shoulder endurance. For contact sport athletes, exercises emphasize dynamic stabilization and proprioception to withstand the physical demands of their sport. The rehabilitation program is tailored to the individual's sport-specific needs, as highlighted in <reference refid="8746"></reference> and <reference refid="7992"></reference>. Additionally, <reference refid="3460"></reference> provides insights into the effectiveness of different rehabilitation strategies, underscoring the importance of personalized exercise regimens.</p><p>Rehabilitation milestones are typically set to guide the recovery process and ensure timely progression. By weeks six to nine, patients are expected to achieve full passive ROM, with active ROM and strengthening exercises continuing to advance. By week 16, most patients are ready to return to their previous activity levels, provided they meet the functional criteria and demonstrate adequate shoulder strength and stability. These timelines are consistent with findings from <reference refid="1992"></reference>, which provide a broader context for expected outcomes and potential challenges in the rehabilitation process. Regular follow-up and radiological assessments, as mentioned in <reference refid="8746"></reference>, are also crucial to monitor graft union and ensure successful recovery.</p>

We found only 4 studies evaluating a total of 914 cases assessing the complication rate 90 days after the Latarjet procedure and 1 study assessing the 30-day complication rate in 163 patients (Table I).2,6,10,11,17 Furthermore, there is a growing trend toward centralization in orthopedic surgery resulting in high-volume hospitals. An example of a program facilitating centralization is the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) program in the United Kingdom. Therefore, most studies assessing complication rates include data from high-volume hospitals. In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90 day complication rates of Latarjet procedures performed in multiple hospitals in the Netherlands from 2015. Each hospital performed a different volume of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. Our hypothesis was that the 90-day complication rate in Dutch hospitals with different volumes would be higher than the rates reported in the literature at high-volume centers summarized in Table I (&gt;4%-9%). Our secondary hypothesis was that several patient and surgical factors (ie, sex, age, body mass index [BMI], smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time) might affect the risk of complications.</p><p></p></blockquote>"

However, a previous study by Moga et al42 reported a shorter learning curve and better graft positioning with the ABB procedure compared with the AL procedure. Of course, potential drawbacks of the ABB procedure, that is, the increased graft-related complication rate, the cost of an allograft, or donor-site morbidity, should be taken into account in the decision making of the clinician.</p><p>When interpreting the results of this review, baseline differences in the sample size and frequency of participation in sports with a high risk of dislocations in the AL and ABB groups should be considered potential sources of bias. With regard to the mean sample size, we believe that the comparison of weighted rates performed using a proportional meta-analytic method and subsequent metaregression might have partially overcome the difference at baseline. The presence of a larger number of patients participating in contact or overhead sports in the AL group could be interpreted by considering 2 factors. First, data on the practice of at-risk sports have been reported less frequently in the ABB group (251 cases [53.5%]) than in the AL group (610 cases [67.2%]). Second, some studies comparing Latarjet and Bankart repair have demonstrated a higher loss of external rotation for the anatomic procedure,27 which is why some authors recommend the Latarjet procedure to treat patients involved in sports requiring a high degree of external rotation.4 This preference could represent a selection bias in our analysis.</p><p></p></blockquote>"

For our secondary question, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. If observations on the predictor variables were missing, these variables were not included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, screw size was divided into 2 groups: 3.5 mm and &gt;3.5 mm. We also performed backward elimination for the multivariable logistic regression with a P value cutoff of .157<a href=\"#page-6-22\">.15</a> P &lt; .05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software (version 14; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We identified 537 patients who underwent Latarjet procedures. Of these patients, 5 (0.93%) were excluded because no data regarding complications were reported (loss to follow-up owing to further control visits at another hospital after the surgeon left the hospital). The remaining 532 patients were included in the final analysis. Eleven patients underwent arthroscopic Latarjet procedures, whereas all other patients underwent open Latarjet procedures. Demographic characteristics and the number of complications per demographic factor are summarized in <a href=\"#page-4-0\">Table III.</a> The number of Latarjet procedures performed per hospital varied from 5 to 116. The complication rate per hospital ranged from 2.7% to 25%. The average age at the time of the operation was 29.9 10.1 years. A total of 94 patients (17.7%) were women and 438 (82.3%) were men. In total, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred <a href=\"#page-4-1\">(Table IV)</a>. Of the 8 infections, 1 was superficial, requiring antibiotics, and 7 were deep, requiring a second surgical procedure.</p>\n<p>The average age of the patients with complications was 28.9 10.6 years, and the average age of the patients without complications was 30.1 10.0 years. The average BMI was 24.4 5.7 kg/m2 in patients with complications and 20.7 22.4 kg/m2 in patients without complications. The mean operation time was 81.3 39.4 minutes in patients with complications and 80.5 26.9 minutes in patients without complications. All patients underwent 2 screw fixation except for 3 patients who underwent fixation with 1 screw and 2 patients who received 3 screws.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

		<h3>Performance Outcomes</h3>
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 18,
		  "html_expectations": "This subsection examines whether athletes regain their pre-injury performance levels and any residual deficits in shoulder mobility or power. It considers the role of psychological readiness and reinjury fear."
		}
		-->
		<p>Athletes undergoing the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure for anterior shoulder instability often experience substantial improvements in their post-surgery performance levels. Clinical scores such as the UCLA and Constant scores, which are indicators of shoulder function and stability, show marked enhancements postoperatively. For example, the Latarjet group demonstrated an improvement in the UCLA score from 14.2 preoperatively to 31.1 postoperatively, and the Constant score from 51 to 90.2, indicating a high level of functional recovery <reference refid="5933"></reference>. These improvements suggest that athletes can expect to regain a considerable degree of their pre-injury performance levels, although individual outcomes may vary based on factors such as the extent of preoperative damage and adherence to rehabilitation protocols.</p><p>Residual deficits in shoulder mobility and power are important considerations for athletes aiming to return to sport. The range of motion (ROM) improvements post-surgery are notable, with significant gains in forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation observed in both the Latarjet and ICBG groups <reference refid="5933"></reference>. However, some studies suggest that while ROM can be restored to near-normal levels, subtle deficits may persist, particularly in high-demand sports requiring extensive overhead activity <reference refid="4510"></reference>. Power recovery is generally favorable, but the degree of recovery can be influenced by the surgical technique and the rehabilitation process. The choice between screw and flexible fixation methods, for instance, can impact hardware-related complications, which in turn affect power recovery <reference refid="1639"></reference>.</p><p>Psychological readiness and fear of reinjury are significant factors influencing an athlete's return to sport. The psychological aspect of recovery is often underestimated, yet it plays a crucial role in the overall rehabilitation process. Athletes may experience anxiety about reinjury, which can hinder their performance and delay their return to competitive levels. Addressing these concerns through psychological support and counseling can enhance readiness and confidence, facilitating a smoother transition back to sport <reference refid="7293"></reference>. Evidence suggests that comprehensive rehabilitation programs that incorporate psychological readiness assessments can improve outcomes and reduce the fear of reinjury <reference refid="4510"></reference>.</p><p>To optimize performance outcomes, several strategies can be employed. Tailored rehabilitation programs that focus on both physical and psychological aspects are vital. Emphasizing gradual progression in activity levels, alongside regular monitoring of clinical scores and ROM, can help identify and address any deficits early in the recovery process. Additionally, employing evidence-based practices, such as those outlined in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, can guide clinicians in refining surgical and rehabilitation techniques to enhance athlete performance post-surgery <reference refid="1639"></reference>. By integrating these strategies, athletes are more likely to achieve successful outcomes and return to their pre-injury performance levels. Furthermore, the study by Alkaduhimi et al. highlights the importance of considering patient characteristics such as age, sex, and previous instability surgery, which can influence recovery and performance outcomes <reference refid="9172"></reference>. This comprehensive approach ensures that athletes receive personalized care, maximizing their potential for a successful return to sport.</p>

		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure for anterior shoulder instability presents a complex interplay of benefits and challenges. Key findings from the literature indicate that while the procedure effectively stabilizes the shoulder and minimizes soft tissue damage compared to open techniques, it is not without its challenges. The steep learning curve and potential for hardware-related complications, such as graft malposition and screw pullout, remain significant concerns <reference refid="2416"></reference>. Despite these issues, the procedure's ability to address glenoid bone loss and its lower recurrence rates compared to soft tissue repairs make it a valuable option for specific patient populations <reference refid="8972"></reference>.</p><p>Quantitative data from recent studies highlight a 10.9% complication rate within 90 days post-surgery, with gender being a notable factor influencing these outcomes <reference refid="8043"></reference>. This underscores the importance of careful patient selection, particularly considering factors such as sex, age, and previous shoulder operations. The merits of the procedure, including its minimally invasive nature and effectiveness in treating concurrent joint issues, suggest it is well-suited for patients with significant glenoid bone loss or those who have failed previous stabilization surgeries <reference refid="3565"></reference>. Additionally, Mahmoud et al. found that while the Latarjet procedure had fewer complications compared to iliac crest bone grafting, both techniques showed comparable functional outcomes, emphasizing the need for tailored patient selection <reference refid="2852"></reference>.</p><p>Future research should focus on standardizing the measurement of bone loss and developing a national registry to track long-term outcomes and complications, as suggested by Alkaduhimi et al. <reference refid="8745"></reference>. Moreover, the study by Cozzolino et al. highlights the need for further investigation into sport-specific rehabilitation protocols and timelines, as the demands of different sports may influence recovery and performance outcomes <reference refid="1646"></reference>. Understanding these nuances will aid in tailoring postoperative care to optimize return-to-sport success.</p><p>As we move forward, it is essential to emphasize the importance of evidence-based practice in refining patient selection criteria and improving surgical outcomes. Continued research and the establishment of comprehensive registries will be vital in enhancing the procedure's efficacy and safety for athletes and non-athletes alike <reference refid="9748"></reference>.</p>

We found only 4 studies evaluating a total of 914 cases assessing the complication rate 90 days after the Latarjet procedure and 1 study assessing the 30-day complication rate in 163 patients (Table I).2,6,10,11,17 Furthermore, there is a growing trend toward centralization in orthopedic surgery resulting in high-volume hospitals. An example of a program facilitating centralization is the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) program in the United Kingdom. Therefore, most studies assessing complication rates include data from high-volume hospitals. In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90 day complication rates of Latarjet procedures performed in multiple hospitals in the Netherlands from 2015. Each hospital performed a different volume of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. Our hypothesis was that the 90-day complication rate in Dutch hospitals with different volumes would be higher than the rates reported in the literature at high-volume centers summarized in Table I (&gt;4%-9%). Our secondary hypothesis was that several patient and surgical factors (ie, sex, age, body mass index [BMI], smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time) might affect the risk of complications.</p><p></p></blockquote>"

ABB, arthroscopic free bone block; AL, arthroscopic Latarjet.</p><p>included in this meta-analysis did not allow us to draw conclusions about this topic. However, a previous study by Moga et al42 reported a shorter learning curve and better graft positioning with the ABB procedure compared with the AL procedure. Of course, potential drawbacks of the ABB procedure, that is, the increased graft-related complication rate, the cost of an allograft, or donor-site morbidity, should be taken into account in the decision making of the clinician.</p><p>When interpreting the results of this review, baseline differences in the sample size and frequency of participation in sports with a high risk of dislocations in the AL and ABB groups should be considered potential sources of bias. With regard to the mean sample size, we believe that the comparison of weighted rates performed using a proportional meta-analytic method and subsequent metaregression might have partially overcome the difference at baseline. The presence of a larger number of patients participating in contact or overhead sports in the AL group could be interpreted by considering 2 factors. First, data on the practice of at-risk sports have been reported less frequently in the ABB group (251 cases [53.5%]) than in the AL group (610 cases [67.2%]). Second, some studies comparing Latarjet and Bankart repair have demonstrated a higher loss of external rotation for the anatomic procedure,27 which is why some authors recommend the Latarjet procedure to treat patients involved in sports requiring a high degree of external rotation.4 This preference could represent a selection bias in our analysis.</p><p></p></blockquote>"

For our secondary question, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. If observations on the predictor variables were missing, these variables were not included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, screw size was divided into 2 groups: 3.5 mm and &gt;3.5 mm. We also performed backward elimination for the multivariable logistic regression with a P value cutoff of .157<a href=\"#page-6-22\">.15</a> P &lt; .05 was considered significant.

Of these patients, 5 (0.93%) were excluded because no data regarding complications were reported (loss to follow-up owing to further control visits at another hospital after the surgeon left the hospital). The remaining 532 patients were included in the final analysis. Eleven patients underwent arthroscopic Latarjet procedures, whereas all other patients underwent open Latarjet procedures. Demographic characteristics and the number of complications per demographic factor are summarized in <a href=\"#page-4-0\">Table III.</a> The number of Latarjet procedures performed per hospital varied from 5 to 116. The complication rate per hospital ranged from 2.7% to 25%. The average age at the time of the operation was 29.9 10.1 years. A total of 94 patients (17.7%) were women and 438 (82.3%) were men. In total, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred <a href=\"#page-4-1\">(Table IV)</a>.

The average BMI was 24.4 5.7 kg/m2 in patients with complications and 20.7 22.4 kg/m2 in patients without complications. The mean operation time was 81.3 39.4 minutes in patients with complications and 80.5 26.9 minutes in patients without complications. All patients underwent 2 screw fixation except for 3 patients who underwent fixation with 1 screw and 2 patients who received 3 screws.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

>>>		<p><lock>The typical timeline for returning to sport after an arthroscopic Latarjet procedure generally ranges from 3 to 6 months post-surgery. This period is influenced by several factors, including the severity of the initial injury, the athlete's adherence to rehabilitation protocols, and the presence of any complications. According to Mahmoud et al., most patients returned to their pre-injury activity levels, with only one pati<reference refid="3492"></reference>ent in the Latarjet group not achieving this outcome <reference refid="5040"></reference>. This suggests a high success rate for returning to sport, provided that the rehabilitation process is followed diligently.</lock></p><p><comment comment-id="7582">Factors influencing the speed of recovery include patient compliance with rehabilitation protocols and the presence of graft-related complications. Alkaduhimi et al. reported a 10.9% complication rate within 90 days post-surgery, with common issues such as nerve injury and material failure potentially delaying recovery <reference refid="8688"></reference>. This highlights the importance of monitoring for complications and addressing them promptly to facilitate a smooth recovery. Additionally, the type of fixation used during surgery can impact recovery speed. Cozzolino et al. found that flexible fixation was associated with fewer hardware-related complications compared to screw fixation, which can influence the timeline for returning to sport <reference refid="9485"></reference>.<reference refid="1286"></reference></comment></p><p>Success rates for athletes returning to sport are generally high, but they can be affected by graft-related complications. The meta-analysis by Cozzolino et al. found no significant difference in recurrence rates between arthroscopic Latarjet and other bone block procedures, indicating that the procedure is effective in maintaining shoulder stability <reference refid="3196"></reference>. However, the presence of graft-related complications, such as malposition or resorption, can hinder the recovery process and affect the athlete's ability to return to their previous level of performance. Alkaduhimi et al. also noted that the complication rate varied significantly across different hospitals, ranging from 2.7% to 25%, which may reflect differences in surgical expertise and hospital protocols <reference refid="2578"></reference>. <mention time="Today at 11:08 AM" author="Guillaume Draznieks">@ Maybe analyse more this reference please</mention></p><p><lock>Patient compliance plays a vital role in the success of the recovery process. Adhering to rehabilitation protocols, which typically involve a period of immobilization followed by progressive mobilization and strengthening exercises, is crucial for optimal outcomes. Psychological factors, such as fear of reinjury and confidence in the shoulder's stability, also influence the return to sport. Athletes who are mentally prepared and confident in their recovery are more likely to achieve successful outcomes. Overall, the combination of a well-structured rehabilitation program, effective management of complications, and psychological readiness are key determinants of successful return to sport after an arthroscopic Latarjet procedure.</lock></p>
