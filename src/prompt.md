	Background: In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90-day complication rates following the Latarjet procedure. Data from 2015 were collected from multiple hospitals in the Netherlands, with different volumes of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. 
	
	Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 13 hospitals between 2015 and 2022. Data regarding complications within 90 days of Latarjet procedures were extracted. The effect of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time on the complication rate was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. 
	
	Results: Of the 532 included patients, 58 (10.9%) had complications. The most common complications were material failure (n ¼ 19, 3.6%) and nerve injury (n ¼ 13, 2.4%). The risk of complications was lower for male patients than for female patients (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77; P ¼ .006). Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time were not associated with complications.

	Conclusion: The 90-day complication rate after the Latarjet procedure was 10.9% and was higher in female patients than in male patients. Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time did not affect complication rates. We advise setting up a national registry to prevent under-reporting of complications.

	For anterior shoulder instability, bony procedures (eg, the Latarjet procedure) or soft-tissue procedures (eg, Bankart repair) can be performed.[19](#page-6-0) During Bankart repair, a torn labrum is repaired using sutures and/or anchors, whereas during the Latarjet procedure, the coracoid with its attached tendons is transferred to the anteroinferior part of the glenoid[.12](#page-6-1) The coracoid, as such, acts as an anterior buttress, and the conjoined tendon acts as a sling to prevent the shoulder from dislocating[.3](#page-6-2),[14](#page-6-3) In general, the Latarjet procedure results in a lower redislocation rate compared with arthroscopic Bankart repair (2.7% vs. 15.1%, P < .001) but a higher complication rate (9.4% vs. 0%, P ¼ .002)[.16](#page-6-4) Complications such as nerve injury, infection, hematoma, screw failure (migration, bending, or breakage), and bony nonunion are frequently encountered after the Latarjet procedure[.8](#page-6-5),[13](#page-6-6) Although the complication rate of the Latarjet procedure is higher, there are not significantly more complications requiring revision compared with arthroscopic Bankart repair (5.0% vs. 3.1%).[1](#page-6-7) Previous reports have shown that factors associated with complications after the Latarjet procedure include smoking[,2](#page-6-8) increased age,[7](#page-6-9)[,18](#page-6-10) workers' compensation claim,[18](#page-6-10) surgeon experience,[5](#page-6-11) and use of 4.0- and 4.5-mm cannulated screws instead of 3.5-mm cortical screws.[18](#page-6-10) 
	
	Most complication rates are reported for a longer term (ie, 30 days-316 months) after the operation.[2,](#page-6-8)[6](#page-6-12)[,7,](#page-6-9)[9-11](#page-6-13)[,17,](#page-6-14)[18](#page-6-10) Regarding the short-term complication rate, the literature is scarce. We found only 4 studies evaluating a total of 914 cases assessing the complication rate 90 days after the Latarjet procedure and 1 study assessing the 30-day complication rate in 163 patients ([Table I)](#page-2-0).[2](#page-6-8)[,6](#page-6-12),[10](#page-6-15)[,11,](#page-6-16)[17](#page-6-14) Furthermore, there is a growing trend toward centralization in orthopedic surgery resulting in high-volume hospitals. An example of a program facilitating centralization is the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) program in the United Kingdom. Therefore, most studies assessing complication rates include data from high-volume hospitals. In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the 90 day complication rates of Latarjet procedures performed in multiple hospitals in the Netherlands from 2015. Each hospital performed a different volume of Latarjet procedures. Our second aim was to examine which patient and surgical factors were associated with complications. Our hypothesis was that the 90-day complication rate in Dutch hospitals with different volumes would be higher than the rates reported in the literature at high-volume centers summarized in [Table I](#page-2-0) (>4%-9%). Our secondary hypothesis was that several patient and surgical factors (ie, sex, age, body mass index [BMI], smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time) might affect the risk of complications.

	## Methods
	
	This was a multicenter retrospective study. This study has been reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guidelines (Supplementary Appendix S1).
	
	#### Patient selection and data acquisition 
	
	Sixteen surgeons from the Dutch Shoulder and Elbow Society were recruited to share data on Latarjet procedures and complications in their hospitals. All surgeons operating on shoulders and elbows in the Netherlands are members of the Dutch Shoulder and Elbow Society. The digital care systems of all collaborating hospitals were scanned for patients who underwent Latarjet procedures between 2015 and the time of data acquisition [(Table II](#page-3-0)). We included operations performed the surgeons who participated in this study, as well as operations performed by surgeons in the same hospitals as the participating surgeons. It is mandatory to

	have complication registries in Dutch hospitals. The complication registries of the corresponding hospitals were collected and screened for complications within 90 days of Latarjet procedures. To ensure that no complication was missed, the records of hospital visits were also screened for complications. 
	
	The Latarjet procedure was defined as a transfer of the coracoid with the conjoined tendon regardless of the fixation method. A complication was defined as any adverse event related to the Latarjet procedure requiring treatment within 90 days of the Latarjet procedure, such as nerve injury, infection, major hematoma, material failure, nonunion, or malunion. A patient with a nerve injury was defined as a patient referred to a neurologist with or without an additional electromyography and/or nerve conduction study. Graft malposition that was discovered after 90 days was also included because malpositioning occurs during the operation. 
	
	A higher-volume hospital was defined as a hospital in which >40 Latarjet procedures were performed between 2015 and 2020. Subsequently, 6 of the 13 hospitals evaluated were classified as higher-volume centers whereas the other 7 were deemed lowervolume centers.
	
	#### Population characteristics
	
	Alongside complication rates, data regarding patient characteristics and surgical characteristics were extracted. Patient characteristics included age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and previous instability surgery. Surgical characteristics included duration of operation and data regarding fixation method: screw or cortical button, number of screws or cortical buttons, and screw diameter. The exclusion criteria were patients who underwent concomitant procedures and/or were lost to follow-up.
	
	#### Rehabilitation
	
	The rehabilitation protocols were analogous in all participating hospitals. A sling was worn for 2-6 weeks postoperatively. Movement was limited to 90 of flexion and abduction and 0 of external rotation for the first 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, active and passive ranges-of-motion exercises were performed. Sport-specific exercises were performed after 3 months.

	#### Statistical analysis
	
	To answer our primary study question, complication rates were calculated and presented descriptively. For our secondary question, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. If observations on the predictor variables were missing, these variables were not included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, screw size was divided into 2 groups: 3.5 mm and >3.5 mm. We also performed backward elimination for the multivariable logistic regression with a P value cutoff of .157[.15](#page-6-22) P < .05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software (version 14; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
	
	## Results
	
	We identified 537 patients who underwent Latarjet procedures. Of these patients, 5 (0.93%) were excluded because no data regarding complications were reported (loss to follow-up owing to further control visits at another hospital after the surgeon left the hospital). The remaining 532 patients were included in the final analysis. Eleven patients underwent arthroscopic Latarjet procedures, whereas all other patients underwent open Latarjet procedures. Demographic characteristics and the number of complications per demographic factor are summarized in [Table III.](#page-4-0) The number of Latarjet procedures performed per hospital varied from 5 to 116. The complication rate per hospital ranged from 2.7% to 25%. The average age at the time of the operation was 29.9 10.1 years. A total of 94 patients (17.7%) were women and 438 (82.3%) were men. In total, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred [(Table IV)](#page-4-1). Of the 8 infections, 1 was superficial, requiring antibiotics, and 7 were deep, requiring a second surgical procedure.
	
	The average age of the patients with complications was 28.9 10.6 years, and the average age of the patients without complications was 30.1 10.0 years. The average BMI was 24.4 5.7 kg/m2 in patients with complications and 20.7 22.4 kg/m2 in patients without complications. The mean operation time was 81.3 39.4 minutes in patients with complications and 80.5 26.9 minutes in patients without complications. All patients underwent 2 screw fixation except for 3 patients who underwent fixation with 1 screw and 2 patients who received 3 screws.

	508 cases were evaluated in the multivariable analysis. Sex was significantly associated with complications, with male patients having a lower risk (odds ratio, 0.40 [95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.77]; P ¼ .006). The other variables did not affect complication rates. In addition, after the application of backward elimination, only sex affected complication rates (odds ratio, 0.44 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.83]; P ¼ .011). All outcomes regarding the multivariable analysis are summarized in [Table V.](#page-5-0) The complications among female patients consisted of nerve injury in 6 (6%), material failure in 5 (5%), graft malposition in 3 (3%), recurrent instability in 2 (2%), and tendon irritation in 1 (1%).

	## Discussion 
	
	In our study population, 58 complications (10.9%) occurred within 90 days of the Latarjet procedure. The risk of complications was lower for male patients in comparison to female patients but was not significantly affected by age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time. 
	
	Our results are different from those reported in the existing literature. First, our complication rate is higher than generally reported in the literature: 10.9% vs. 4%-9% [(Table I)](#page-2-0).[2](#page-6-8)[,6,](#page-6-12)[10](#page-6-15)[,11,](#page-6-16)[17](#page-6-14) We presume that this may be related to the participation of hospitals with low volumes of Latarjet surgical procedures. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, we have mandatory complication registries that are monitored yearly by the Dutch government. As a result of such complication registries, the staff of Dutch hospitals has become more focused on reporting complications. This could explain the higher complication rate in our study. However, the multivariable analysis did not reveal an association between higher and lower volumes and the complication rate. We speculate that this may be because of more complex cases being referred to higher-volume centers. These more complex cases could be more difficult to operate on and might be accompanied by more comorbidity or more bone loss, both resulting in a higher complication rate. Another explanation is that we evaluated volumes per hospital and not volumes per surgeon. We considered hospitals to be high-volume hospitals if >40 Latarjet procedures were performed over a 5-year period because surgeons achieve a level of proficiency after 22 open Latarjet procedures and most of the hospitals had 2-3 surgeons operating on shoulder instability patients[.5](#page-6-11) Evaluating volumes per hospital could lead to an overestimation of the

	volumes of Latarjet procedures that are performed per surgeon (eg, in a high-volume hospital with many surgeons performing Latarjet procedures, it could be that surgeons do not perform the Latarjet procedure that often). An alternative could be to assess the effect of the volumes of shoulder instability surgery per surgeon or volumes of shoulder surgery per hospital or surgeon on complication rates. However, we did not have access to these data. Second, in our population, only male sex was associated with a decreased risk of complications. In previous literature, relevant factors affecting complication rates were surgeon experience, smoking, increased age, workers' compensation claim, and screw type and size.[2,](#page-6-8)[7](#page-6-9)[,18](#page-6-10) We do not have an explanation for this discrepancy. We speculate that the fact that male sex was less associated with complications is a result of hyperlaxity (female patients are more prone to have shoulder hyperlaxity, most likely because of higher levels of relaxin) and anatomic differences (female patients have a more oval-shaped glenoid)[.4](#page-6-23) Although the relaxin theory could explain the differences in recurrence rates, it does not provide an explanation for the other differences, (eg, nerve injury). Furthermore, the difference in the sample sizes between male patients and female patients hampers interpretation of the observed difference in complication rates. A more precise estimate of the difference between sexes requires a larger number of female patients. 
	
	These findings add relevant information to the existing literature, in which high-volume hospitals have been overrepresented. This study also includes low-volume hospitals and is the largest original study assessing 90-day complication rates after the Latarjet procedure (532 patients vs. 133-441 patients). 
	
	Our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, owing to the retrospective design of this study, not all potentially relevant variables were available for analysis, such as operation indication, Instability Severity Index Score, amount of bone loss, and postoperative graft positioning. Therefore, it was not possible to explore how these variables affect the incidence and type of complications. Second, despite the substantial number of participating hospitals and patient data, only 58 complications occurred within the 90-day period assessed. This limits the statistical power to demonstrate the influence of potential prognostic variables. Nevertheless, with 58 complications, the power is considered sufficient to detect 3-6 prognostic variables. Therefore, the lack of power does not explain why no variable other than sex was associated with the risk of complications in our study. Third, the BMI of the Dutch patients included in our study is representative of a fairly normal body habitus. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the effect of BMI on complications. Fourth, we cannot exclude the possibility that surgeons with high complication rates may have been less likely to participate. Moreover, complications were potentially missed if a patient did not go back to the same surgeon or hospital. To improve future research and the quality of health care, we are developing a nationwide registry to capture all surgical procedures and complications prospectively.

<!-- chunk from informationid="1" with position="16" -->

	
	Future studies should have a prospective design to ensure that milder complications are not missed. Furthermore, blinding of assessors was not possible because of the retrospective character of our study. The lack of blinding may lead to under-reporting of complications. For example, surgeons could be less prone to report on transient neuropathy owing to its self-limiting character. This issue cannot be solved by questioning patients retrospectively because of potential recall bias. In addition, the effect of complications on patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction should be studied. A milder complication might have an impact on rehabilitation and thus may affect patientreported outcomes and satisfaction. 
	
	Given the popularity of the Latarjet procedure and the growing need for assessment of the potential benefits and  
	
	risks of this operation, it is advisable to set up a registry database comparable to the arthroplasty registry. Registries provide a large amount of essential information regarding outcomes and can be used to adjust the tools and operative techniques needed for better outcomes. By setting up a national registry database, under-reporting of complications can be prevented by collecting data prospectively, and thus, the risks of retrospectively collecting data can be avoided. Furthermore, the long-term complication rates can be registered and analyzed in a national registry. This can improve our understanding of the clinical course after the Latarjet procedure.
	
	## Conclusion
	
	The 90-day complication rate after the Latarjet procedure was 10.9% and was higher in female patients than in male patients. Age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, type of fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time did not affect complication rates. We advise setting up a national registry to prevent under-reporting of complications.

	#### What is already known?
	
	There is no published study with a mean 4-year follow-up comparing the functional outcome between Laterjet and arthroscopic assisted iliac bone graft in management of glenoid deficiency, with scarcity of the studies comparing both techniques.
	
	### What are the new findings?
	
	To our knowledge this the first comparative study with a mean 4 year follow-up reporting the clinical outcome and the complication rate of both techniques. There was statistically significant improvement in Constant and UCLA score of both methods at the last follow-up. We did not find statistically significant difference in the clinical outcomes between both, but the complication rate is smaller in Laterjet treatment group.

	#### Introduction 
	
	Recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability is usually related to disruption of the anteroinferior labrum, "Bankart tear"; however, patients with recurrent instability of the glenohumeral joint have glenoid defect [\[1,](#page-5-0)[2\]](#page-5-1). 
	
	The integrity of the bony arc of the glenoid is the most crucial factor related to the success of the surgical repair. Glenoid bone injury may affect the stability of the glenohumeral joint, leading to further dislocation or subluxation [[3](#page-5-2)]. 
	
	Preoperative radiology is important for the diagnosis and estimation of bony defects in patients with recurrent instability. The apical oblique and West Point views are essential radiographs for assessing glenoid bone defects. If any bony injury is suspected, computed tomography (CT) can provide important data about the size of the bone defect. Additionally, three-dimensional reconstruction CT with digital subtraction of the humeral head provides an en face sagittal view of the glenoid, allowing accurate measurements of the percentage of the glenoid bone defect [[4](#page-5-3)]. 
	
	The most popular option for anterior glenoid defect (20%) in recurrent shoulder dislocation is the coracoid transfer (Laterjet). Eden–Hybinette used a tricortical iliac bone graft for larger glenoid defects with an irreparable capsular-ligamentous structure that may not be completely restored in coracoid transfer and after the failure of Laterjet surgeries [[5](#page-5-4)]. With the development of arthroscopic techniques, iliac bone block grafting can be assisted arthroscopically [\[6\]](#page-5-5). 
	
	Few published studies compared the clinical outcomes of both techniques. They concluded that both were effective and reliable, with no consensus on the superiority of one technique over the other [\[7](#page-6-0)]. This study aims to assess the clinical outcome using Constant and UCLA scores and report the complication rates of Latarjet and arthroscopic-assisted iliac crest bone graft transfer (ICBG) in anterior shoulder instability with the glenoid bone loss with a mean 4-year follow-up. The study hypothesis was that both techniques had satisfactory clinical results, but the Laterjet procedure is better with respect to the complication rate.

	#### Discussion 
	
	The important finding in this study is the statistically significant improvement of the Constant score from 51 5.5 preoperative to 90.2 4.6 postoperative in Laterjet, and from 53.6 6.04 to 89 5.01 in ICBG. Also, the preoperative UCLA score improved from 14.2 3.3 to 31.1 2.1 postoperative in Laterjet, and from 15.4 3.1 to 30.2 2.2 in ICBG, with no evidence of a difference between them at the end of followup. The complication rate among the Laterjet group (4%) was lower than ICBG (24%). The hypothesis of our study is confirmed. 
	
	Because this trial is the first to consider a mean 4-year post-operative follow-up, the sparsely available 2-year follow-up comparative trial and case series were considered for comparison [[7](#page-6-0)]. 
	
	<span id="page-4-1"></span>Recurrent anterior instability of the shoulder joint is a major problem 
	
	in young athletic patients [\[15](#page-6-8)]. Disturbance of the static and dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder joint leads to various grades of instability. Joint conformity, intraarticular negative pressure, glenoid labrum and ligaments, specifically the anterior and posterior bands of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, had a major role in shoulder instability [\[16](#page-6-9)]. The rotator cuff and scapular muscles are dynamic restraints for joint stability [[16\]](#page-6-9). The presence of bony defects increases the risk of recurrence. An engaging bony lesion had been explained by the concept of glenoid track in high-risk patients [[17\]](#page-6-10). Burkhart and De Beer [[18](#page-6-11)] reported 67% of recurrence after arthroscopic soft tissue repair alone in patients with significant glenoid loss, compared with just 4% in those without it. Glenoid and humeral bony defects or bipolar bone defects raised concerns among orthopaedic surgeons. 
	
	Latarjet surgery is the most widely used procedure as it provides a triple-blocking effect to support anterior shoulder instability. First, the coracoid transfer to the glenoid rim increases the surface area of the glenoid safe arc. Second, the conjoined tendon reinforces the anterior capsule, preventing forward translation of the humeral head when the

	arm is abducted and externally rotated (sling effect). Finally, the bumper effect of the anterior capsule and glenoid labrum is restored [\[19](#page-6-12)]. 
	
	Iliac bone graft techniques become an alternative for previous failed Latarjet procedures. Iliac bone graft reconstruction is biomechanically less valuable than coracoid transfer techniques because of the lack of a sling effect. However, iliac crest grafts have effectively been used to rebuild the stability in high-risk patients and as a revision technique after failed Bristow–Latarjet procedures [\[20](#page-6-13)[,21](#page-6-14)]. 
	
	Regarding ROM, the results were comparable to those of Kraus et al. [[22\]](#page-6-15). They did not report statistical differences in postoperative ROM compared to the contralateral side. Their final forward flexion, abduction, and ER were 177, 174 and 70, respectively. Additionally, Anderl et al. [\[23](#page-6-16)] stated that the ROM improved significantly as matched to the preoperative values. Full abduction and ER had been reached after surgery as stated by Bockmann et al. [\[24](#page-6-17)]. Moreover, Zhao et al. [\[25](#page-6-18)] observed that almost all patients of their series had normal ultimate postoperative ROM. This study revealed a final mean IR in the ICBG which was comparable to the results of Moroder et al. [[7](#page-6-0)], except that there was a statistically significant difference between both treatment groups in their results. The longer follow-up period and rehabilitation may be an explanation for this finding. 
	
	The UCLA score in the Latarjet group showed improvement with a postoperative score of 31.1 2.1. This is close to the result of Castricin et al. [\[26](#page-6-19)] (32.5 2 in 44 patients) and lower than the result of Krajcsovics et al. [[27\]](#page-6-20) (33.30 points in 32 patients). The Constant score in the coracoid transfer group showed improvement from 51 5.5 to 90.2 4.6. This is comparable to the result of Ersen et al. [[13\]](#page-6-6) in 31 patients (from 55.7 preoperatively to 91.7 postoperatively). The Constant score in the ICBG group was close to the results of Russo et al. [\[14](#page-6-7)] (89 5.01 vs 88.9). The UCLA score in the ICBG group was improved at the end of the study (30.2 2.2). The ultimate result was consistent with Russo et al. [[14\]](#page-6-7) (31.5 in 19 patients) and slightly inferior to the result of Choke et al. [\[28\]](#page-6-21) (32.14 in seven patients).

	#### Limitation of the study
	
	There are some weak points related to this work. The sample size was small. To increase the confidence in the conclusions, a larger number of patients is needed in the future to give more power to statistical tests through the detection of the small effect size difference between both techniques. Additionally, a longer follow-up duration (more than 5 years) is needed to report the remote complications that may not appear earlier. Arthroscopic-assisted ICBG is technically demanding, which needs stepwise learning. Finally, the lack of randomization is also another weak point of this clinical trial.
	
	#### Conclusion
	
	Latarjet procedure and arthroscopic-assisted ICBG had good clinical outcomes of Constant and UCLA shoulder scores in management of anterior glenoid bony defects. The complication rate in Laterjet procedure is lower than ICBG, but the functional results of both techniques were comparable. ICBG has better IR; however, this difference is not statistically significant between both groups. ICBG is recommended as an option for secondary instability after failed Latarjet procedure or large glenoid loss, which needs a large bone block. Glenohumeral arthritis was not recorded during the follow-up period. More comparative long-term trials (˃5 years) will be needed to prove the superiority of either technique.

	Results: Of 5010 potentially relevant studies, 18 studies regarding the AL procedure (908 cases) and 15 studies regarding the ABB procedure (469 cases) were included. The 2 groups were comparable in age (*P* = .07), sex (*P* = .14), glenoid bone loss (*P* = .14), number of preoperative dislocations (*P* = .62), proportion of primary and revision procedures (*P* = .95), length of follow-up (*P* = .81), modified Coleman Methodology Score (*P* = .21), and level of evidence (*P* = .49). There was no difference in the recurrence (*P* = .88), reoperation (*P* = .79), and complication (*P* = .08) rates. The subgroup analyses showed a higher rate of hardware-related complications for screw fixation compared with flexible fixation (*P* = .01). 
	
	Conclusion: The AL and ABB procedures had similar recurrence, reoperation, and complication rates. Screw fixation of the bone graft was related to an increased risk of complications compared with flexible fixation.

	During the last few years, growing interest in arthroscopic glenoid bone grafting techniques to treat anterior shoulder instability has been observed. The development of these techniques is related to a number of factors. First, different clinical studies have reported a higher recurrence rate and  
	
	worse clinical outcomes after arthroscopic Bankart repair compared with the open Latarjet procedure.29,65 Second, the threshold value for glenoid bone defects considered suitable for soft tissue repair has been progressively reduced.16,50,52 Moreover, the introduction of the ''glenoid track'' concept has highlighted the importance of the humeral location of bone loss in addition to its volume.31,32,49 As such, several surgical techniques have been introduced to improve the results of arthroscopic treatment versus those of the widely used open Latarjet procedure. Humeral Hill-Sachs remplissage,46 subscapularis tenodesis,38 and capsular augmentation with the long head of the biceps tendon15 have all been described to

	improve the results of classic Bankart repair. Unfortunately, these soft tissue procedures often lead to reduced range of motion, higher postoperative pain, and an increased recurrence rate compared with the Latarjet procedure, especially in patients with glenoid bone loss .15%.44,61 
	
	In this context, both the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL)30 and the arthroscopic free bone block (ABB) procedures,41 introduced by different authors in 2007, aim to restore glenohumeral stability by reducing the complication rate of the open Latarjet procedure and enabling the simultaneous treatment of other joint structures. Indeed, the main advantages of arthroscopic bone graft procedures are the reduction of soft tissue iatrogenic damage, the possibility of treating posterior or superior labral tears, and the possibility of treating Hill-Sachs lesions (if off-track, even after the restoration of glenoid bone loss). 
	
	Upon a review of the literature, we found different studies that have compared the results of the open Latarjet procedure and glenoid bone grafting, showing no significant differences in terms of recurrence and clinical outcomes.43 Regarding arthroscopic procedures, there is only 1 retrospective study that has compared the AL and ABB procedures.59 When dealing with case series, it is obvious that some bias toward reporting favorable results should be considered, which is why these studies are often unlikely to have an effect on clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis aiming to identify the best arthroscopic procedure has been published so far. 
	
	The purpose of this systematic review was to compare recurrence, complication, and reoperation rates after the AL and ABB procedures. We hypothesized that no difference would be observed between the 2 treatment groups.
	
	# METHODS
	
	# Registration
	
	The study's protocol was registered online in the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) database (CRD42022368153). This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.34
	
	# Search Strategy
	
	To identify clinical studies investigating the arthroscopic treatment of anterior shoulder instability with either the AL or the ABB procedure, we used a combination of the following keywords for the article search: ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Bone Block'' OR ''Bone Graft,'' ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Glenoid Augmentation'' OR ''Glenoid Reconstruction,'' and ''Arthroscopic'' AND ''Latarjet'' OR ''Coracoid Graft'' OR ''Coracoid Transfer.''
	
	# Study Selection
	
	There were 2 reviewers (A.C. and R.G.) who performed an independent literature search in 3 electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. The titles and abstracts were reviewed for all search results, and potentially eligible studies were selected. Results were then cross-checked. In the case of disagreement, a third author (P.M.) was involved until a consensus was reached. Included articles underwent a full-text review. Finally, the reference lists of included articles and review studies were screened for any additional articles that were not identified in the database search.

	# Eligibility Criteria 
	
	The inclusion criteria were longitudinal studies (retrospective and prospective) evaluating the treatment outcomes of the AL or ABB procedure in patients affected by isolated anterior shoulder instability, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, with no limitation concerning the publication date. The exclusion criteria included the following: case reports, expert opinions, previous systematic reviews, letters to the editor, and cadaveric studies; descriptions of surgical techniques without clinical results; studies with \24-month minimum follow-up; studies that included different treatment methods in which data for the AL or

	One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: R.R. has received grants and nonfinancial support from LimaCorporate and nonfinancial support from Smith & Nephew outside the submitted work. AOSSM checks author disclosures against the Open Payments Database (OPD). AOSSM has not conducted an independent investigation on the OPD and disclaims any liability or responsibility relating thereto. 
	
	ABB procedure alone could not be extrapolated; articles with a sample size \10 cases; revision procedures after previous treatment methods including some form of bone management (open or arthroscopic Latarjet, bone block, Eden-Hybinette, etc); cases with an established diagnosis of epilepsy; patients affected by multidirectional instability; and studies with missing data regarding the complication, recurrence, and reoperation rates. For studies by the same author(s) and with potential overlapping, we selected the one with the largest sample size and excluded the others from analysis.
	
	#### Data Extraction
	
	There were 2 reviewers (R.G. and P.M.) who independently extracted relevant data from the included articles and recorded them onto Excel spreadsheets (Version 2007; Microsoft). The 2 Excel files were then matched, with the senior author (A.C.) arbitrating in the case of disagreement. Data extracted included the following: study design, level of evidence, patient characteristics, number of preoperative dislocations, previous instability surgery, type and level of sport, bone loss, preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes, imaging modality, type of graft and fixation technique, return to sport, recurrence of instability after surgery, and complication and reoperation rates.
	
	Regarding complications, we focused on the following: persistent apprehension, hardware-related complications, graft-related complications, glenohumeral arthritis, infections, nerve palsy, and graft malposition. Graft nonunion, complete graft resorption, and graft fracture were all included as graft-related complications. Local pain stimulated by direct pressure over scar tissue, clicking, and screw pullout or breakage were all considered hardwarerelated complications.

	procedure, concluding that, despite stronger fixation provided by screws, no differences in terms of clinical outcomes could be detected between the 2 methods of fixation.9,11,45 In this meta-analysis, hardware-related complications were more frequent in patients treated with screws (3.6%) than in those for whom flexible fixation methods (0.4%) were used (P = .01), independent from the type of surgery performed (AL or ABB). For this reason, we recommend using button fixation to reduce the potential effect of prominent screws, especially in the ABB group. 
	
	Despite the similar outcomes, the ABB procedure has a few theoretical advantages compared with the AL procedure. First, avoiding subscapularis split and coracoid osteotomy generally reduces surgical times and the risk of bleeding and postoperative shoulder hematoma. Second, the absence of the attached conjoint tendon certainly facilitates the correct position of the bone block. Both factors could theoretically reduce the learning curve and facilitate the propagation of the surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the lack of data on surgical times in primary studies

	included in this meta-analysis did not allow us to draw conclusions about this topic. However, a previous study by Moga et al42 reported a shorter learning curve and better graft positioning with the ABB procedure compared with the AL procedure. Of course, potential drawbacks of the ABB procedure, that is, the increased graft-related complication rate, the cost of an allograft, or donor-site morbidity, should be taken into account in the decision making of the clinician. 
	
	When interpreting the results of this review, baseline differences in the sample size and frequency of participation in sports with a high risk of dislocations in the AL and ABB groups should be considered potential sources of bias. With regard to the mean sample size, we believe that the comparison of weighted rates performed using a proportional meta-analytic method and subsequent metaregression might have partially overcome the difference at baseline. The presence of a larger number of patients participating in contact or overhead sports in the AL group could be interpreted by considering 2 factors. First, data on the practice of at-risk sports have been reported less frequently in the ABB group (251 cases [53.5%]) than in the AL group (610 cases [67.2%]). Second, some studies comparing Latarjet and Bankart repair have demonstrated a higher loss of external rotation for the anatomic procedure,27 which is why some authors recommend the Latarjet procedure to treat patients involved in sports requiring a high degree of external rotation.4 This preference could represent a selection bias in our analysis.

	### A b s t r a c t 
	
	Background. – The purpose of this review was to compare clinical outcomes, return to sport (RTS), and complications in comparative studies examining patients undergoing primary Latarjet procedure versus Latarjet in the revision setting following soft tissue stabilization. 
	
	Methods. – A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria consisted of level I to III human clinical studies reporting clinical outcomes (Visual Analogue Pain Scale [VAS]), RTS metrics, and complications in patients following primary versus revision Latarjet procedures. Study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. 
	
	Results. – A total of seven studies, consisting of 1170 patients (n = 1179 shoulders) with a mean age of 26.4 years, consisting of 91.9% males (n = 1083/1179 shoulders), were identified. Mean final follow-up was 46.4 (mean range, 7.3–72.2) months. A total of 748 primary and 431 revision Latarjet procedures were analyzed. Complications were reported in 9.6% (range, 0%–24.2%) of patients undergoing primary and 20.2% (range, 0%–40.7%) in patients undergoing revision procedures (p = 0.22). There was no significant difference in the RTS rate between patients undergoing primary (87.3%; range, 83.8%–92.1%) versus Latarjet as a revision procedure (78.9%; range, 60%–100%) (p = 0.08). Moreover, no significant difference in postoperative VAS was observed in patients undergoing primary versus Latarjet as a revision procedure (p = 0.21). Recurrent shoulder subluxation was significantly greater in patients undergoing revision (12.0%; n = 31/259 shoulders; range, 0%–20.7%) compared to primary procedures (3.3%; n = 27/511 shoulders; range, 0%–9%) (p < 0.001). 
	
	Discussion. – Patients undergoing primary and revision Latarjet demonstrated overall similar rates of complications and return to sport. Of clinical importance, Latarjet as a revision procedure possessed a risk of recurrent subluxation 3.6 times higher than primary Latarjet. While effective, patients should be counseled regarding the differing prognosis between Latarjet as a primary or revision procedure. Level of evidence. – III; Systematic review and meta-analysis.

	#### **1. Introduction** 
	
	Anterior shoulder instability occurs in 1–2% ofthe general population and up to 15% of collision sport athletes [\[1–4\].](#page-8-0) Potential sequelae of instability include decreased range of motion, disability, and time lostfrom sport. Instability events are a common cause of shoulder labral tears, which have been reported to occur at a rate of 0.12 per 1000 athletic exposures [\[5\].](#page-8-0) In patients with persistent instability refractory to non-operative management without substantial glenoid bone loss, arthroscopic soft-tissue stabilization is often indicated to restore glenohumeral stability. In contrast, for athletes with glenoid bone loss over 13% or those with recurrent instability following isolated soft tissue stabilization [\[6–8\],](#page-8-0) a bone block procedure may be indicated [\[9,10\].](#page-8-0) The Latarjet procedure is amongst the most commonly used bony augmentation procedures and consists of a transfer of the anterior aspect of the coracoid process to the anteroinferior glenoid in order to restore bone anatomy while also providing additional restraint through the sling effect of the conjoint tendon. 
	
	When compared to isolated soft tissue stabilization, bony augmentation has been reported to decrease the rate of subsequent recurrent shoulder instability, with postoperative dislocation rates as low as 2.7% [\[11\].](#page-8-0) When used in the setting of failed prior soft tissue stabilization, Latarjet has been shown to be superior compared to revision soft-tissue stabilization in terms of recurrent anterior instability [\[12–14\].](#page-8-0) However, both primary and revision Latarjet procedures may be complicated by superficial wound infections, neuropraxia, nonunion, osteolysis, hematoma, and hardware complications [\[8,11,15,16\].](#page-8-0) In addition, it remains unclear whether revision Latarjet following soft tissue stabilization provides similar outcomes as compared to primary treatment with Latarjet. 
	
	Therefore, the purpose of this review was to compare return to sport and complications in comparative studies examining patients undergoing primary Latarjet procedure versus Latarjet in the revision setting following soft tissue stabilization. We hypothesized in the revision setting, patients would have inferior outcomes and RTS rates, as well as increased complications when compared to primary Latarjet.

	#### 2.1. Article Identification and Data Extraction
	
	A literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers (G.J., T.T.) in July 2022, using the PubMed and Scopus databases. The search strategy followed the 2020 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Meta-Analyses) guidelines and included the following search terms combined with Boolean operators: 'Latarjet', 'Shoulder instability', 'Shoulder dislocation', 'Coracoid transfer', 'Failed Bankart', 'Revision stabilization', and 'Recurrent instability' [\[17\].](#page-8-0) The inclusion criteria included comparative level I to III human clinical studies written in English or with English-language translation reporting a return to sport, and/or complications in patients undergoing Latarjet augmentation as a primary or revision procedure. Case reports, cadaver studies, animal studies, studies with overlapping cohorts, letters to the editors, review articles, and non-English studies were excluded. Title and abstract screening were conducted by two independent reviewers (G.J., T.T.), followed by full-text screening ([Fig.](#page-3-0) 1).
	
	Data were extracted from the included studies using Microsoft Excel version 16.63 (Redmond, WA, USA) and consisted of the following: article title, first author's name, level of evidence (as per Wright et al. [\[18\]\),](#page-8-0) year of publication, mean follow-up, patient demographics, surgical technique performed, patient-reported outcome measures, return to sport (RTS), complications, and re-operations. When available, the mean value, standard deviation, and range were recorded.
	
	#### 2.2. Outcome measures
	
	Return to Sports (RTS), postoperative Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), and complication rates were recorded. Outcome scores were only calculated when reported in three or more studies based on prior studies [\[19–21\].](#page-8-0) The VAS is a subjective pain scale based on self-reported pain from 0 to 100.An ideal score, indicating "no pain" is from 0–4, while "mild pain" is represented by a score of 5 to 44, "moderate pain" from 45 to 74, and "severe pain" from 75 to 100 [\[22\].](#page-8-0)
	
	#### 2.3. Risk of bias assessment
	
	In order to minimize bias, a methodological quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria [\[3\]](#page-8-0) was conducted by two independent reviewers (S.A., D.D.). The MINORS tool is a numerical scale consisting of 12 questions with each question scored as the following: 0 if not reported, 1 if reported but inadequate, or 2 reported and adequate. An ideal total score for non-randomized studies is 24.

	#### 2.4. Statistical analysis
	
	Postoperative VAS scores were pooled and compared using forest plots created via the meta-analysis software Review Manager 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration, London, U.K.). The forest plots analyzed the individual study weights, standardized mean difference, and 95% confidence interval for each article included in this review. The event outcomes for postoperative complications were also compared using forest plots representing the individual study weights, odds ratio, and the 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance was established with a p-value < 0.05.
	
	#### **3. Results**
	
	Seven studies, consisting of a total of 1170 patients (n = 1179 shoulders) were identified. The mean MINORS score was 18.9 (range, 17–21) for included studies ([Fig.](#page-4-0) 2). 748 patients (63%) underwent a primary Latarjet procedure, whereas 431 (37%) underwent Latarjet as a revision procedure ([Table](#page-2-0) 1). Mean patient age was 26.4 years and consisted of 91.9% males (n = 1083/1179 shoulders) with a mean follow-up of 46.4 (mean range, 7.3–72.2) months. Five studies [\[4,8,16,23,24\]](#page-8-0) reported on the use of open Latarjettechniques, while two [\[14,25\]](#page-8-0) studies includedbotharthroscopic and mini-open techniques. In patients undergoing revision surgery, the most commonly reported index procedure was a failed arthroscopic Bankart repair (39.9%, n = 172/431 shoulders).
	
	The reported incidence of complications in patients undergoing Latarjet in a revision (not exclusively due to failed arthroscopic Bankart repair) setting was 20.2% (n = 87/431 shoulders; range, 0%–40.7%; n = 7 studies) compared to 9.6% (n = 72/748 shoulders; range, 0%–24.2%; n = 7 studies) in the primary setting, with no statistically significant difference (odds ratio (OR), 0.80; p = 0.22) ([Fig.](#page-4-0) 3).
	
	#### 3.1. Return to Sport (RTS)
	
	Return to sport (RTS), here defined as the return to any level of sport, was reported in four studies [\[14,23–25\]](#page-8-0) There was no significant difference in the RTS rate between patients undergoing primary (87.3%; n = 393/450 patients; range, 83.8%–92.1%) versus

	#### 3.2. Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS)
	
	Three studies compared differences in post-operative VAS. No significant difference was observed in patients undergoing primary (WeightedMean, 1.5; range, 1.2–2) versus Latarjet as a revisionprocedure (Weighted Mean, 2.0; range, 1.2–2.7)(WMD = −0.53, 95% Cl, −1.34 to 0.29; p = 0.21) [\(Fig.](#page-5-0) 5).
	
	#### 3.3. Complications
	
	No significant difference was found in post-operative hematoma formation in patients undergoing primary (1.2%; n = 8/664 shoulders) versus Latarjet as a revision procedure (1.1%; n = 4/368 shoulders) (odds ratio, 0.85; p = 0.79) ([Fig.](#page-5-0) 6).
	
	No significant difference in the incidence of postoperative infection was appreciated in the primary (1.0%; n = 4/394 shoulders; range, 0.7%–1.5%) versus revision (0.8%; n = 7/875 shoulders; range, 0.3%–3%) Latarjet groups (odds ratio, 0.93; p = 0.94) [\(Fig.](#page-5-0) 7).
	
	No significant difference was appreciated in the reported incidence of post-operative neuropraxia in primary (1.7%; n = 6/344 shoulders; range, 0%–5%) versus revision (1.1%; n = 4/352 shoulders; range, 0%–3%) Latarjet (odds ratio, 2.08; p = 0.50) [\(Fig.](#page-5-0) 8).

	#### **4. Discussion** 
	
	The main finding of this meta-analysis was that patients undergoing Latarjet as a revision procedure exhibited a significant risk of recurrent subluxation 3.6 times higher than primary Latarjet (p < .05). Furthermore, future episodes of redislocation can be prevented in most patients that undergo primary or Latarjet as a revision procedure. No significant difference in RTS or overall complications was found between primary and Latarjet as a revision (p > .05). These findings negate our original hypothesis of significant differences in complications and RTS. 
	
	Recurrent subluxations were observed to be significantly more common in revision (12%) versus primary (3.3%) patients. These findings are consistent with prior investigations reporting recurrent instability rates (7.5–11.6%) following Latarjet as a revision procedure [\[19\]](#page-8-0) In a recent systematic review of 245 patients treated with a Latarjet after the failure of a previous soft-tissue stabilization, Lau et al. identified a recurrent subluxation rate ranging from 0% to 16.7% at a mean follow-up of 43 months [\[21\]](#page-8-0) Although our review identified an increased incidence of recurrent subluxation in Latarjet patients in the revision setting, both primary and revision Latarjet successfully prevented dislocations in most patients. Within this review, the estimated redislocation rate of 2.3% (range, 0%–7.4%)in primary Latarjet and a 3.2%(range, 0%–5.2%) with Latarjet as a revision procedure at a mean follow-up of 46.4 (mean range, 7.3–72.2) months. However, no statistical difference in dislocation rates between the two procedures was found (p < .05). These findings suggest a slightly lower recurrence rate than previously reported in a systematic review by Bhatia et al. in patients undergoing Latarjet for the treatment of recurrent dislocations (0–8%) [\[26\].](#page-8-0) 
	
	In this review, most patients returned to sports at the same preoperative level or higher following primary Latarjet (87.3%) and Latarjet as a revision procedure (78.9%), with no significant difference between the two groups was observed (p = .08). Similarly, a recent systematic review of 2134 cases from 36 studies observed that the overall RTS rate was 89% at an average of 5.8 (range, 3.2–8) months following primary Latarjet [\[27\]](#page-8-0) In contrast, other studies have suggested lower RTS rates in patients undergoing Latarjet as a revision procedure compared to primary intervention [\[28\]](#page-8-0) When comparing the RTS rate in patients undergoing revision Latarjet to other arthroscopic and bone block anterior stabilization revision procedures, Lau et al. [\[28\]](#page-8-0) reported a RTS rate of 67.1%. The likely decreased incidence of successful RTS following revision surgery may be related to greater levels of disability or pain following the

	index surgery, warranting revision surgery with bony augmentation. While the difference in RTS rate between groups in this study was not significant, (p = .08), the proportion of patients not returning to sport was almost two-fold higher in the revision group. This finding highlights the need for additional, homogenous studies with larger cohorts which may subsequently demonstrate a difference in the currently observed trend as well as identify factors influencing the success and failure of RTS in patients undergoing Latarjet surgery as a primary versus revision procedure. 
	
	In the presented meta-analysis, no difference in the incidence of complications in patients undergoing Latarjet as a revision procedure versus patients treated with Latarjet as a primary procedure was identified (p < .05). While this finding is noteworthy given the potentially increased difficulty of revision procedures, the similar complication rates observed may also highlight the minimally invasive nature of arthroscopic soft tissue stabilization procedures, which appear not to substantially effect the observed complication rate following revision surgery [\[29\]](#page-8-0) Nevertheless surgeons should be prepared for adhesions, altered anatomy, and associated technical challenges in the setting of prior surgery.

	The present review is not without limitations. No randomized control trials were identified meeting our inclusion criteria for this review, as allthe included studies were of retrospective design, corresponding to a level of evidence of III. The low-quality evidence of the included studies increased the risk of selection and confounding bias. Notwithstanding, the included studies represented a fairly homogenous patient population with similar methods, allowing the authors to appropriately pool the data; however, potential differences in groups included in the arthroscopic vs open procedures could introduce selection bias. Secondly, patient-reported outcome measures were infrequently reported, largely precluding the ability to perform any meaningful analysis to assess for differences in outcomes between patients undergoing Latarjet as a primary or revision procedure. RTS timing was also reported in a limited number of patients, further preventing an analysis of this variable. Furthermore, the presence of recurrent subluxation is subjective and may have been overinterpreted among the included studies. Of the included studies, data with both arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures were included together which introduces some variability of complications as they may be different between open versus arthroscopic Latarjet. Finally, as is inherent to every systematic review, our search strategy and eligibility criteria may have unintentionally excluded investigations or patient subgroups whose data might have contributed to a more thorough statistical analysis, had they been included.
	
	#### **5. Conclusion**
	
	Patients undergoing primary and revision Latarjet demonstrated overall similar rates of complications and return to sport. Of clinical importance, Latarjet as a revision procedure possessed a risk of recurrent subluxation 3.6 times higher than primary Latarjet. While effective, patients should be counseled regarding the differing prognosis between Latarjet as a primary or revision procedure.

		<p>Anterior shoulder instability is a prevalent condition, particularly affecting young athletes, characterized by recurrent dislocations or subluxations of the shoulder joint. This instability often results from disruptions in the anteroinferior labrum, known as a Bankart tear, and is frequently associated with glenoid bone defects <reference refid="5169"></reference>. Addressing these bony defects is vital, as they greatly influence the success of surgical repairs and the long-term stability of the shoulder joint <reference refid="5523"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Traditional surgical approaches to shoulder instability have primarily focused on soft tissue repairs. However, these methods have shown higher recurrence rates, especially in patients with substantial glenoid bone loss <reference refid="3744"></reference>. This has led to the development and increased adoption of bony surgical procedures, such as the Latarjet technique, which involves transferring the coracoid process to the glenoid rim to increase the surface area and provide a triple-blocking effect <reference refid="5523"></reference>. The Latarjet procedure has become a cornerstone in managing anterior shoulder instability, particularly in sports medicine, due to its ability to address both soft tissue and bony deficiencies effectively <reference refid="3744"></reference>.</p>
		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet technique has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to the traditional open procedure. This approach offers several advantages, including reduced surgical trauma, faster recovery times, and potentially lower complication rates <reference refid="3744"></reference>. Comparative studies have shown that while both the arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures are effective in reducing recurrence rates, the arthroscopic approach may offer additional benefits in terms of patient satisfaction and functional outcomes <reference refid="5523"></reference>. Despite these advantages, the arthroscopic technique presents unique challenges, such as a steep learning curve and technical difficulties in graft positioning and fixation <reference refid="3744"></reference>. The detailed procedural steps involved in the mini-open Latarjet, as described in <reference refid="5728"></reference>, highlight the complexity and precision required, underscoring the technical demands of the surgery.</p>
		<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in arthroscopic techniques for shoulder surgery, driven by advancements in technology and a better understanding of shoulder biomechanics. These techniques are particularly relevant in sports medicine, where the demand for procedures that allow athletes to return to their pre-injury level of performance is high <reference refid="3744"></reference>. The arthroscopic Latarjet, with its ability to address bony defects and enhance joint stability, plays a vital role in the surgical management of anterior shoulder instability, offering a promising option for both patients and clinicians <reference refid="5523"></reference>. The broader context of these advancements is well-documented in systematic reviews, such as the one outlined in <reference refid="9963"></reference>, which provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of arthroscopic procedures for shoulder instability.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the importance of addressing bony defects is supported by foundational studies on glenoid bone loss and its impact on shoulder stability, as referenced in <reference refid="2527"></reference>. These studies emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and surgical intervention in preventing recurrence and improving patient outcomes. By integrating these insights, the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure continues to evolve, offering a refined approach to managing anterior shoulder instability in both general and sports-specific contexts. This evolution is crucial for developing more effective treatment protocols and improving long-term outcomes for patients suffering from this challenging condition.</p>

		}
		-->
		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, while offering a minimally invasive approach to addressing anterior shoulder instability, presents several technical challenges that can substantially impact surgical outcomes. One of the primary hurdles is the steep learning curve associated with mastering the technique. Surgeons must develop advanced arthroscopic skills, which require extensive training and experience. This complexity is compounded by the need for precise graft positioning, a factor that is vital for ensuring the stability and success of the procedure. Inaccurate placement can lead to complications such as graft malposition or recurrent instability, as highlighted in studies emphasizing the importance of surgical expertise in minimizing these risks <reference refid="7051"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Fixation concerns unique to arthroscopy further complicate the procedure. The choice between screw fixation and flexible fixation methods can influence the rate of hardware-related complications. A meta-analysis comparing these methods found that screw fixation was associated with a higher incidence of complications (3.6%) compared to flexible fixation (0.4%) <reference refid="9918"></reference>. This underscores the need for careful consideration of fixation techniques to optimize patient outcomes. Additionally, the requirement for specialized surgical tools and equipment can pose logistical challenges, particularly in settings with limited resources. The use of advanced instrumentation, as depicted in surgical procedure images, highlights the necessity for precision and sterility in handling materials critical to the procedure <reference refid="6326"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Intraoperative visualization difficulties are another notable challenge in the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure. The confined space and complex anatomy of the shoulder joint can hinder the surgeon's ability to clearly view and access the surgical site. This can lead to increased operative times and potentially affect the precision of the procedure. The need for high-quality arthroscopic equipment and advanced imaging techniques is crucial to overcoming these visualization barriers <reference refid="5112"></reference>. Despite these challenges, the procedure's minimally invasive nature offers benefits such as reduced recovery times and less postoperative pain, making it a valuable option for patients when performed by skilled surgeons.</p>
		<p>The impact of these technical challenges on surgical outcomes is significant. Studies have shown that the learning curve and technical demands of the arthroscopic Latarjet can influence complication rates and overall success <reference refid="4623"></reference>. Moreover, the lack of high-quality, prospective studies on the procedure limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about its efficacy compared to other techniques <reference refid="3958"></reference>. As such, ongoing training and the development of standardized protocols are essential to improving the safety and efficacy of the procedure. By addressing these challenges, surgeons can enhance their ability to deliver successful outcomes for patients undergoing the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure.</p>

		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, while effective for addressing anterior shoulder instability, presents several complications that must be carefully managed to optimize patient outcomes. This section outlines the primary complications associated with the procedure, including nerve injury, hardware failure, graft malposition, infection, and graft resorption, along with strategies to mitigate these issues.</p>
		<p>Nerve injury is a notable risk in the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure due to the proximity of the surgical site to major nerves. This can result in sensory or motor deficits, impacting patient recovery. In a study of 532 Latarjet procedures, nerve injury was reported in 17.2% of cases with complications, underscoring the importance of meticulous surgical technique to minimize this risk <reference refid="5317"></reference>. Strategies to reduce nerve injury include careful dissection and the use of intraoperative nerve monitoring.</p>
		<p>Hardware failure, particularly related to screw fixation, is another common complication. The use of screws for graft fixation has been associated with a higher rate of hardware-related complications compared to flexible fixation methods. Specifically, screw fixation resulted in a 3.6% complication rate, significantly higher than the 0.4% observed with flexible methods <reference refid="8804"></reference>. This suggests that alternative fixation techniques may be beneficial in reducing hardware-related issues. Additionally, the study by Mahmoud et al. (2022) highlights that hardware-related problems, such as screw prominence, can lead to persistent pain, necessitating hardware removal <reference refid="7695"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Graft malposition can compromise the stability and success of the procedure. Accurate positioning of the graft is crucial, as malposition can lead to recurrent instability or impingement. In the Dutch study, graft malposition was noted in 10.3% of cases with complications <reference refid="5317"></reference>. Ensuring proper visualization and positioning during surgery is essential to prevent this complication. The comparative study by Mahmoud et al. (2022) also emphasizes the importance of precise graft placement to avoid complications associated with medialization <reference refid="7695"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Infection, although less common, remains a concern. The incidence of infection in the Latarjet procedure was reported at 13.8% among patients with complications, with deep infections requiring additional surgical intervention <reference refid="5317"></reference>. The study by Mahmoud et al. (2022) provides additional context, noting that donor site infections in iliac crest bone grafting can occur, although they are generally manageable with antibiotics and dressing <reference refid="7695"></reference>. Adhering to strict aseptic techniques and postoperative care protocols can help mitigate the risk of infection.</p>
		<p>Graft resorption is a potential long-term complication that can affect the stability of the shoulder. The meta-analysis found a 4.0% rate of total graft resorption in the arthroscopic free bone block group, compared to 0.2% in the Latarjet group <reference refid="3624"></reference>. While the clinical impact of graft resorption is still debated, it underscores the importance of selecting appropriate graft materials and fixation methods to enhance graft viability. The study by Mahmoud et al. (2022) also highlights the lower resorption rates observed with autogenous iliac bone grafts, suggesting that graft origin plays a role in resorption outcomes <reference refid="7695"></reference>.</p>
		<p>To address these complications, ongoing improvements in surgical techniques and training are necessary. The development of national or international registries could also facilitate better data collection and analysis, leading to more evidence-based practices and improved patient outcomes. By understanding and addressing the complication profile of the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, surgeons can enhance the safety and efficacy of this important surgical intervention. This understanding will also aid in developing strategies to mitigate these complications, such as optimizing graft positioning and exploring alternative fixation methods.</p>

The risk of complications was lower for male patients in comparison to female patients but was not significantly affected by age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time.</p>\n<p>Our results are different from those reported in the existing literature. First, our complication rate is higher than generally reported in the literature: 10.9% vs. 4%-9% <a href=\"#page-2-0\">(Table I)</a>.<a href=\"#page-6-8\">2</a><a href=\"#page-6-12\">,6,</a><a href=\"#page-6-15\">10</a><a href=\"#page-6-16\">,11,</a><a href=\"#page-6-14\">17</a> We presume that this may be related to the participation of hospitals with low volumes of Latarjet surgical procedures. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, we have mandatory complication registries that are monitored yearly by the Dutch government. As a result of such complication registries, the staff of Dutch hospitals has become more focused on reporting complications. This could explain the higher complication rate in our study. However, the multivariable analysis did not reveal an association between higher and lower volumes and the complication rate. We speculate that this may be because of more complex cases being referred to higher-volume centers. These more complex cases could be more difficult to operate on and might be accompanied by more comorbidity or more bone loss, both resulting in a higher complication rate. Another explanation is that we evaluated volumes per hospital and not volumes per surgeon. We considered hospitals to be high-volume hospitals if &gt;40 Latarjet procedures were performed over a 5-year period because surgeons achieve a level of proficiency after 22 open Latarjet procedures and most of the hospitals had 2-3 surgeons operating on shoulder instability patients<a href=\"#page-6-11\">.5</a> Evaluating volumes per hospital could lead to an overestimation of the</p>\n<p><span id=\"page-5-0\"></span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Table V</th>\n  <th></th>\n  <th>Results of multivariable analysis</th>\n  <th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>---------</td>\n  <td>--</td>\n  <td>-----------------------------------</td>\n  <td>--</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Factor</th>\n  <th>Coefficient</th>\n  <th>95% CI for</th>\n  <th>OR</th>\n  <th>95% CI</th>\n  <th>P value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td>coefficient</td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td>for OR</td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Sex: male (reference category, female)</td>\n  <td>0.92</td>\n  <td>1.57 to 0.26</td>\n  <td>0.40</td>\n  <td>0.21-0.77</td>\n  <td>.006</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Age</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.05 to 0.01</td>\n  <td>0.98</td>\n  <td>0.95-1.01</td>\n  <td>.196</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>BMI</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.01 to 0.04</td>\n  <td>1.02</td>\n  <td>0.99-1.04</td>\n  <td>.267</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Smoking: yes (reference category, no)</td>\n  <td>0.03</td>\n  <td>0.56 to 0.65</td>\n  <td>1.03</td>\n  <td>0.55-1.92</td>\n  <td>.927</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Previous instability surgery: yes (reference category, no)</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.63 to 0.59</td>\n  <td>0.99</td>\n  <td>0.53-1.81</td>\n  <td>.957</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Fixation method (reference category, cortical screw)</td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Cannulated screw</td>\n  <td>0.19</td>\n  <td>0.64 to 1.02</td>\n  <td>1.21</td>\n  <td>0.53-2.79</td>\n  <td>.651</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Plate with screw</td>\n  <td>0.06</td>\n  <td>1.12 to 1.25</td>\n  <td>1.07</td>\n  <td>0.33-3.49</td>\n  <td>.913</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Cancellous screw not fully threaded</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>1.42 to 1.47</td>\n  <td>1.02</td>\n  <td>0.24-4.33</td>\n  <td>.976</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Volume of center: higher volume (reference category, lower volume)</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.77 to 0.73</td>\n  <td>0.98</td>\n  <td>0.46-2.07</td>\n  <td>.953</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Screw size: &gt;3.5 mm (reference category, 3.5 mm)</td>\n  <td>0.16</td>\n  <td>0.83 to 1.15</td>\n  <td>1.17</td>\n  <td>0.44-3.15</td>\n  <td>.752</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Operation time</td>\n  <td>0.001</td>\n  <td>0.01 to 0.01</td>\n  <td>1.0</td>\n  <td>0.99-1.01</td>\n  <td>.807</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; BMI, body mass index.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

>>>		-->
>>>		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, while offering certain clinical advantages, demands higher resource utilization compared to the traditional open Latarjet approach. This increased demand is primarily due to the need for advanced surgical tools, such as specialized arthroscopic equipment and implants, which contribute to longer operative times. The complexity of the arthroscopic technique requires surgeons to be proficient in arthroscopic skills, which can extend the learning curve and necessitate additional resources for training and equipment acquisition. These factors collectively lead to higher initial costs for healthcare systems, as they must invest in both the technology and the training required to perform the procedure effectively <reference refid="3197"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>When comparing the arthroscopic Latarjet to open procedures, the differences in resource requirements become more pronounced. The open Latarjet is generally considered less resource-intensive, as it does not require the same level of specialized equipment or training. This can result in shorter operative times and reduced costs associated with surgical tools. However, the arthroscopic approach may offer benefits in terms of reduced postoperative recovery times and potentially lower complication rates, which could offset some of the initial cost differences over the long term <reference refid="2461"></reference>. Despite these potential benefits, the upfront costs associated with the arthroscopic procedure remain a notable consideration for healthcare providers. The study by Cozzolino et al. (2024) highlights that while hardware-related complications are more frequent with screw fixation, the use of flexible fixation methods can reduce these issues, potentially impacting overall cost-effectiveness <reference refid="4372"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>The economic impact on patients is another important aspect of the cost and resource utilization discussion. Patients undergoing the arthroscopic Latarjet may face higher out-of-pocket expenses due to the increased costs associated with the procedure. These costs can include higher surgical fees and potentially longer rehabilitation periods if complications arise. However, the potential for improved outcomes and quicker return to normal activities may justify these expenses for some patients. Healthcare providers must weigh these factors when recommending surgical options, considering both the short-term financial implications and the long-term benefits for patient health and recovery <reference refid="8450"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>For healthcare systems, the decision to adopt the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure involves balancing the higher initial costs with the potential for improved patient outcomes and reduced long-term healthcare utilization. This requires a comprehensive evaluation of the procedure's cost-effectiveness, taking into account factors such as complication rates, reoperation rates, and patient satisfaction. As the procedure becomes more widespread, it is crucial for healthcare providers to consider these economic implications and to develop strategies that optimize resource allocation while maintaining high standards of patient care. The study by Alkaduhimi et al. (2022) suggests that establishing a national registry could help in capturing comprehensive data on surgical procedures and complications, thereby aiding in more accurate cost assessments and improving healthcare delivery <reference refid="4684"></reference>.</p>

		Arthroscopic Latarjet vs. Open Latarjet
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 13,
		  "html_expectations": "Summarizes the similarities and differences in outcomes between the arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures, including recurrence and complication rates."
		}
		-->
		<p>The comparison between arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures reveals both similarities and differences in clinical outcomes, recurrence, and complication rates. Both techniques are employed to address anterior shoulder instability, yet they present distinct profiles that can influence surgical choice.</p>
		<p><strong>Recurrence and Reoperation Rates</strong>: The recurrence rates for both arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures are notably low, with the arthroscopic approach showing a weighted recurrence rate of 2.0% <reference refid="4015"></reference>. This is comparable to the open procedure, which has been reported to have similar rates of recurrence, underscoring the effectiveness of both techniques in maintaining shoulder stability. Reoperation rates also reflect this trend, with both procedures demonstrating a weighted reoperation rate of 2.0% <reference refid="4015"></reference>. These figures suggest that both surgical approaches are reliable in terms of long-term stability and the need for subsequent surgical interventions.</p>
		<p><strong>Complication Rates and Clinical Outcomes</strong>: Complication rates, however, show some variation between the two methods. The Dutch study reported a 10.9% complication rate for the Latarjet procedure, with material failure and nerve injury being common issues <reference refid="2808"></reference>. In contrast, the meta-analysis indicated a higher complication rate for the arthroscopic approach at 14.0%, compared to 25.0% for the arthroscopic free bone block procedure <reference refid="4015"></reference>. Despite these differences, the overall clinical outcomes, including patient satisfaction and functional recovery, remain favorable for both techniques. The choice between arthroscopic and open procedures may thus depend on the surgeon's expertise and the specific clinical scenario.</p>
		<p><strong>Radiological Outcomes and Patient Satisfaction</strong>: Radiological assessments often reveal successful graft positioning and integration in both procedures, contributing to high levels of patient satisfaction. The arthroscopic approach, with its minimally invasive nature, may offer advantages in terms of cosmetic outcomes and recovery time, potentially enhancing patient satisfaction. However, the open procedure remains a gold standard for many surgeons due to its established track record and direct visualization of the surgical field.</p>
		<p><strong>Implications for Surgical Choice</strong>: The decision to opt for an arthroscopic versus an open Latarjet procedure should consider the surgeon's experience, the patient's specific anatomical and clinical needs, and the potential for complications. While the arthroscopic approach offers the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, it requires a steep learning curve and may be associated with higher resource utilization <reference refid="8417"></reference>. Conversely, the open procedure, with its longer history of use, may be preferred in cases where direct access and visualization are paramount.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, both the arthroscopic and open Latarjet procedures are effective for treating anterior shoulder instability, with each offering unique advantages and challenges. The choice between them should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and the surgeon's expertise, ensuring optimal outcomes in terms of stability, function, and patient satisfaction.</p>
	
	
		Arthroscopic Latarjet vs. Other Bone Block Procedures
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 14,
		  "html_expectations": "Compares the arthroscopic Latarjet with other bone block procedures, focusing on graft viability, union rates, and overall patient satisfaction."
		}
		-->
		<p>The comparison between the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) and other bone block procedures, such as arthroscopic free bone block (ABB), reveals nuanced differences in outcomes and technical considerations. Both procedures aim to address anterior shoulder instability, yet they differ in their approach to graft viability, union rates, and patient satisfaction.</p>
		<p>In terms of graft viability and union rates, the AL procedure demonstrates a lower rate of graft resorption compared to ABB. According to <reference refid="3355"></reference>, the AL group experienced a graft resorption rate of 0.2%, whereas the ABB group had a significantly higher rate of 4.0%. This difference is attributed to the use of autogenous grafts in AL, which tend to integrate better with the host bone. Furthermore, the study by Cozzolino et al. <reference refid="9663"></reference> supports these findings, indicating that the AL procedure has a more favorable profile in terms of graft incorporation and long-term stability.</p>
		<p>Recovery and rehabilitation outcomes are crucial for patient satisfaction and functional scores. Both procedures show improvement in functional scores, such as the Constant and UCLA scores, at the end of follow-up periods. Mahmoud et al. <reference refid="4940"></reference> report statistically significant improvements in these scores for both AL and ABB, with no significant difference in the final outcomes. However, the AL procedure is associated with fewer complications, as noted in <reference refid="3642"></reference>, where the complication rate for AL was 4% compared to 24% for ABB. This lower complication rate contributes to higher patient satisfaction and a smoother rehabilitation process.</p>
		<p>The surgical techniques for AL and ABB differ significantly, impacting the overall outcomes. The AL procedure typically involves the fixation of the coracoid process with screws or buttons, as detailed in <reference refid="9663"></reference>, whereas ABB may use various types of grafts and fixation methods. These technical differences can influence the rate of hardware-related complications, which are more prevalent in ABB due to the use of screw fixation. The study by Cozzolino et al. <reference refid="9663"></reference> highlights that hardware-related complications are a notable concern in ABB, affecting the overall success of the procedure.</p>
		<p>Additionally, the methodology and patient demographics play a crucial role in understanding the outcomes of these procedures. As outlined in <reference refid="3016"></reference>, the study included patients with anterior shoulder instability and significant glenoid defects, providing a comprehensive view of the patient population undergoing these procedures. This context is essential for interpreting the results and making informed clinical decisions.</p>
		<p>The specific surgical techniques used in ABB, such as the tricortical iliac crest bone grafting, are detailed in <reference refid="7502"></reference>. This reference provides insight into the procedural steps and postoperative rehabilitation protocols, which are vital for achieving successful outcomes. Understanding these techniques allows for a more nuanced comparison between AL and ABB, particularly in terms of recovery timelines and functional improvements.</p>
		<p>In terms of long-term stability, both procedures have shown promising results, but the AL procedure may offer a slight advantage due to its lower complication rates and better graft integration. This is supported by the findings in <reference refid="3642"></reference>, which indicate that the AL procedure has a lower incidence of postoperative complications, contributing to its long-term success.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, while both the arthroscopic Latarjet and other bone block procedures effectively address anterior shoulder instability, the AL procedure offers advantages in terms of graft viability, lower complication rates, and patient satisfaction. Clinicians should consider these factors when selecting the appropriate surgical technique, particularly for patients who prioritize a quicker recovery and fewer postoperative complications. The evidence suggests that the AL procedure may be preferable for achieving long-term stability and optimal functional outcomes.</p>

		  "html_expectations": "Analyzes functional scores and subjective assessments of return to daily activities and sports, considering the influence of procedure selection."
		}
		-->
		<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are vital for evaluating the success of surgical interventions for anterior shoulder instability, particularly when comparing the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure with other techniques. Functional scores, such as the Constant and UCLA scores, provide quantitative insights into the effectiveness of these procedures. According to Mahmoud et al. (2022), the mean final Constant score for the Latarjet group was 90.2, compared to 89.0 for the iliac bone graft (ICBG) group, indicating a marked improvement from preoperative scores in both groups (p &lt; 0.0001) <reference refid="3386"></reference>. Similarly, the UCLA scores showed notable postoperative improvements, with the Latarjet group achieving a mean final score of 31.1 compared to 30.2 in the ICBG group, underscoring the efficacy of both procedures in enhancing shoulder function <reference refid="3386"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Subjective assessments of daily activities and patient satisfaction are equally important in evaluating the impact of surgical procedures. The study by Cozzolino et al. (2024) found no significant difference in recurrence rates between the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) and arthroscopic free bone block (ABB) procedures, suggesting comparable patient satisfaction levels <reference refid="4984"></reference>. However, the AL group had a higher proportion of patients involved in contact or overhead sports, which may influence subjective assessments of return to sport and overall quality of life <reference refid="3545"></reference>. This highlights the importance of considering individual patient needs and activity levels when selecting a surgical approach.</p>
		<p>The influence of procedure selection on PROMs is evident when comparing the outcomes of different surgical techniques. The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, while technically challenging, offers advantages in terms of graft positioning and fixation, which can lead to better functional outcomes and patient satisfaction <reference refid="3613"></reference>. The statistical methods used in the meta-analysis, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test and chi-square test, provide a robust framework for comparing outcomes across different studies <reference refid="4984"></reference>. This comprehensive analysis allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different procedures impact patient-reported outcomes.</p>
		<p>In clinical practice, the comparison of PROMs across procedures provides valuable insights for decision-making. The data suggest that while both the arthroscopic Latarjet and other bone block procedures are effective in improving shoulder stability and function, the choice of procedure should be tailored to the patient's individual needs and lifestyle. This personalized approach can enhance patient satisfaction and quality of life, ultimately leading to better long-term outcomes. By integrating quantitative data and subjective assessments, clinicians can make informed decisions that align with the patient's goals and expectations, ensuring a successful return to daily activities and sports. This approach not only optimizes patient outcomes but also supports the development of individualized rehabilitation protocols that cater to the specific demands of each patient.</p>

		Biomechanical Rationale
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 17,
		  "html_expectations": "Reviews how the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure addresses bony defects and creates sling effects, facilitating safer participation in sports."
		}
		-->
		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure is a notable advancement in addressing anterior shoulder instability, particularly in cases involving substantial bony defects. This procedure effectively addresses these defects by transferring the coracoid process to the anterior glenoid, thereby increasing the glenoid arc and providing a bony buttress that prevents further dislocations. Mahmoud et al. (2022) highlight the procedure's efficacy, noting a marked improvement in shoulder stability, as evidenced by the increase in Constant scores from 51 ± 5.5 preoperatively to 90.2 ± 4.6 postoperatively in patients undergoing the Latarjet procedure <reference refid="3387"></reference>. This improvement underscores the procedure's ability to restore the structural integrity of the shoulder joint, which is essential for athletes who require robust joint stability for high-performance activities.</p>
		<p>A key biomechanical advantage of the Latarjet procedure is the creation of a sling effect, which enhances shoulder stability. The conjoined tendon, repositioned along with the coracoid, acts as a dynamic stabilizer, reinforcing the anterior capsule and preventing anterior translation of the humeral head. This sling effect is particularly beneficial for athletes, as it allows for a greater range of motion while maintaining joint stability, facilitating safer participation in sports. Cozzolino et al. (2024) emphasize that the Latarjet procedure, when compared to other stabilization techniques such as arthroscopic free bone block procedures, offers comparable recurrence rates but with a distinct advantage in terms of dynamic stabilization due to the sling effect <reference refid="4298"></reference>.</p>
		<p>The impact of the Latarjet procedure on shoulder stability is further evidenced by its low complication rates compared to other techniques. Mahmoud et al. (2022) report a complication rate of 4% in the Latarjet group, significantly lower than the 24% observed in the iliac crest bone grafting group <reference refid="3387"></reference>. This lower complication rate is crucial for athletes, as it reduces the risk of reoperation and allows for a more predictable recovery trajectory. The procedure's biomechanical advantages, including the increased glenoid arc and dynamic sling effect, contribute to its effectiveness in maintaining shoulder stability, thereby supporting athletes in their return to sport.</p>
		<p>In comparison with other stabilization techniques, the Latarjet procedure offers unique biomechanical benefits that are particularly advantageous for athletes. While other techniques may provide similar recurrence rates, the Latarjet's ability to address both static and dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder joint sets it apart. This dual approach not only enhances joint stability but also minimizes the risk of hardware-related complications, as noted by Cozzolino et al. (2024), who found higher hardware-related complications with screw fixation in other procedures <reference refid="4298"></reference>. For athletes, these biomechanical advantages translate into a more reliable and durable solution for shoulder instability, enabling a safer and more effective return to high-level sports activities.</p>
		<p>To further illustrate the implications for athletes, the procedure's ability to facilitate a safe return to sports is underscored by its biomechanical design, which addresses both bony defects and soft tissue stabilization. This comprehensive approach ensures that athletes can resume activities with confidence, knowing that their shoulder joint is supported by both structural and dynamic stabilizers. Future research could focus on specific sports or activities that benefit most from the Latarjet procedure, providing more tailored rehabilitation protocols and return-to-sport guidelines. Additionally, integrating findings from <reference refid="1070"></reference> could provide further insights into the biomechanical advantages of the Latarjet procedure, particularly in terms of its impact on shoulder stability and athlete performance.</p>
	
	
		Postoperative Rehabilitation
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 18,
		  "html_expectations": "Details recommended rehabilitation protocols, focusing on phases of immobilization, graduated exercises, and the timeline to achieve full range of motion and strength."
		}
		-->
		<p>The postoperative rehabilitation process following the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure is meticulously structured to ensure optimal recovery and facilitate a safe return to sport. Initially, the focus is on immobilization to protect the surgical site and promote healing. Patients are typically required to wear a sling for 2-6 weeks, with movement restricted to 90 degrees of flexion and abduction and 0 degrees of external rotation during the first six weeks <reference refid="6027"></reference>. This phase aims to minimize stress on the repaired structures and prevent complications such as graft malposition or nerve injury.</p>
		<p>As the patient progresses, the rehabilitation protocol transitions to graduated exercises designed to restore range of motion and strength. From weeks 4-5, passive internal rotation is increased to 45 degrees, and external rotation is gradually introduced <reference refid="4681"></reference>. By weeks 6-9, passive forward elevation and abduction are emphasized, with active range of motion exercises introduced to enhance scapular muscle strength. The timeline for range of motion recovery is carefully monitored, with the goal of achieving full shoulder motion by the end of phase III, typically around weeks 10-15 <reference refid="4681"></reference>. Quantitative data from <reference refid="3294"></reference> indicates improvements in range of motion, with mean final forward flexion reaching 166.4 degrees in the Latarjet group.</p>
		<p>Strengthening exercises are a vital component of the rehabilitation process, focusing on the biceps, pectoralis major, minor, and subscapularis muscles. These exercises are progressively intensified to ensure the patient regains full functional capacity. The role of physical therapy is paramount, as therapists guide the patient through each phase, adjusting exercises based on individual progress and monitoring for any signs of complications <reference refid="4681"></reference>. Regular assessments are conducted to evaluate the patient's readiness to advance to more demanding activities. The complication rate, as reported in <reference refid="2685"></reference>, is lower in the Latarjet group compared to the ICBG group, highlighting the effectiveness of the rehabilitation protocol in minimizing adverse outcomes.</p>
		<p>The final phase of rehabilitation involves preparing the patient for a safe return to sport. This includes a comprehensive assessment of the patient's range of motion, strength, and functional capabilities. Factors such as bone healing and muscular strength recovery are crucial in determining the timing of return to high-level sports <reference refid="4780"></reference>. The rehabilitation protocol is adjusted as needed to address any deficits and ensure the patient is fully prepared for the demands of their sport. By adhering to a structured and evidence-based rehabilitation plan, patients can achieve successful outcomes and minimize the risk of re-injury. The use of quantitative measures, such as the Constant and UCLA scores, provides a robust framework for evaluating rehabilitation success and guiding return-to-sport decisions <reference refid="3294"></reference>.</p>
	
	
		Timing and Predictors of Safe Return
		<!--
		informationid and Expectations for the focused version - {
		  "informationid": 19,
		  "html_expectations": "Identifies relevant factors that influence the timeline for athletes to resume high-level sports, including bone healing and muscular strength recovery."
		}
		-->
		<p>The timeline for athletes to safely return to high-level sports following the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure is influenced by several factors, including bone healing, muscular strength recovery, and residual joint laxity. Bone healing is a fundamental determinant, as the integration of the bone graft is necessary for restoring shoulder stability. Studies indicate that the average time for bone healing post-Latarjet is approximately 3 to 6 months, during which the graft undergoes osseous integration and consolidation <reference refid="9409"></reference>. This period is crucial, as premature return to sport can jeopardize the graft's stability and increase the risk of complications. Comparative studies have shown that the Latarjet procedure generally results in fewer complications compared to other techniques, such as iliac crest bone grafting, which can influence the timeline for return <reference refid="2310"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Muscular strength recovery is another key factor in determining the return-to-sport timeline. The restoration of shoulder strength, particularly in the rotator cuff and periscapular muscles, is essential for supporting the joint and preventing re-injury. Rehabilitation protocols typically emphasize progressive strengthening exercises, with most athletes achieving near-normal strength levels by 6 to 9 months post-surgery <reference refid="9848"></reference>. Residual joint laxity, if present, can delay the return to sport, as it may compromise joint stability and increase the risk of dislocation. Addressing laxity through targeted rehabilitation can mitigate this risk and facilitate a safer return <reference refid="5572"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Predictors of a successful return to sport include the degree of bone healing, muscular strength, and the absence of significant joint laxity. Assessment of readiness for sport involves a combination of clinical evaluations and functional tests, such as range of motion assessments and strength measurements. Guidelines for a safe return emphasize the importance of achieving full range of motion, adequate strength, and stability before resuming high-impact activities <reference refid="9925"></reference>. Athletes are typically advised to wait until they have met these criteria, which often aligns with the 9 to 12-month postoperative mark, to minimize the risk of re-injury and ensure optimal performance <reference refid="8820"></reference>.</p>
		<p>Incorporating data from meta-analyses, such as those comparing recurrence and complication rates between the Latarjet and other procedures, can provide additional insights into the predictors of successful return. For instance, the arthroscopic Latarjet has been shown to have comparable recurrence rates to other bone block procedures, which can inform decisions on the timing of return to sport <reference refid="5572"></reference>. Additionally, the study by Alkaduhimi et al. highlights a 10.9% complication rate in Latarjet procedures, underscoring the importance of monitoring for complications during recovery and how they might affect return timelines <reference refid="7004"></reference>. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines and individualized assessments, athletes can achieve a successful and safe return to their sport.</p>

The risk of complications was lower for male patients in comparison to female patients but was not significantly affected by age, BMI, smoking, previous shoulder operations, fixation material, hospital volume, screw size, and operation time.</p>\n<p>Our results are different from those reported in the existing literature. First, our complication rate is higher than generally reported in the literature: 10.9% vs. 4%-9% <a href=\"#page-2-0\">(Table I)</a>.<a href=\"#page-6-8\">2</a><a href=\"#page-6-12\">,6,</a><a href=\"#page-6-15\">10</a><a href=\"#page-6-16\">,11,</a><a href=\"#page-6-14\">17</a> We presume that this may be related to the participation of hospitals with low volumes of Latarjet surgical procedures. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, we have mandatory complication registries that are monitored yearly by the Dutch government. As a result of such complication registries, the staff of Dutch hospitals has become more focused on reporting complications. This could explain the higher complication rate in our study. However, the multivariable analysis did not reveal an association between higher and lower volumes and the complication rate. We speculate that this may be because of more complex cases being referred to higher-volume centers. These more complex cases could be more difficult to operate on and might be accompanied by more comorbidity or more bone loss, both resulting in a higher complication rate. Another explanation is that we evaluated volumes per hospital and not volumes per surgeon. We considered hospitals to be high-volume hospitals if &gt;40 Latarjet procedures were performed over a 5-year period because surgeons achieve a level of proficiency after 22 open Latarjet procedures and most of the hospitals had 2-3 surgeons operating on shoulder instability patients<a href=\"#page-6-11\">.5</a> Evaluating volumes per hospital could lead to an overestimation of the</p>\n<p><span id=\"page-5-0\"></span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Table V</th>\n  <th></th>\n  <th>Results of multivariable analysis</th>\n  <th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>---------</td>\n  <td>--</td>\n  <td>-----------------------------------</td>\n  <td>--</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Factor</th>\n  <th>Coefficient</th>\n  <th>95% CI for</th>\n  <th>OR</th>\n  <th>95% CI</th>\n  <th>P value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td>coefficient</td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td>for OR</td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Sex: male (reference category, female)</td>\n  <td>0.92</td>\n  <td>1.57 to 0.26</td>\n  <td>0.40</td>\n  <td>0.21-0.77</td>\n  <td>.006</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Age</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.05 to 0.01</td>\n  <td>0.98</td>\n  <td>0.95-1.01</td>\n  <td>.196</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>BMI</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.01 to 0.04</td>\n  <td>1.02</td>\n  <td>0.99-1.04</td>\n  <td>.267</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Smoking: yes (reference category, no)</td>\n  <td>0.03</td>\n  <td>0.56 to 0.65</td>\n  <td>1.03</td>\n  <td>0.55-1.92</td>\n  <td>.927</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Previous instability surgery: yes (reference category, no)</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.63 to 0.59</td>\n  <td>0.99</td>\n  <td>0.53-1.81</td>\n  <td>.957</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Fixation method (reference category, cortical screw)</td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Cannulated screw</td>\n  <td>0.19</td>\n  <td>0.64 to 1.02</td>\n  <td>1.21</td>\n  <td>0.53-2.79</td>\n  <td>.651</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Plate with screw</td>\n  <td>0.06</td>\n  <td>1.12 to 1.25</td>\n  <td>1.07</td>\n  <td>0.33-3.49</td>\n  <td>.913</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Cancellous screw not fully threaded</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>1.42 to 1.47</td>\n  <td>1.02</td>\n  <td>0.24-4.33</td>\n  <td>.976</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Volume of center: higher volume (reference category, lower volume)</td>\n  <td>0.02</td>\n  <td>0.77 to 0.73</td>\n  <td>0.98</td>\n  <td>0.46-2.07</td>\n  <td>.953</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Screw size: &gt;3.5 mm (reference category, 3.5 mm)</td>\n  <td>0.16</td>\n  <td>0.83 to 1.15</td>\n  <td>1.17</td>\n  <td>0.44-3.15</td>\n  <td>.752</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Operation time</td>\n  <td>0.001</td>\n  <td>0.01 to 0.01</td>\n  <td>1.0</td>\n  <td>0.99-1.01</td>\n  <td>.807</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; BMI, body mass index.</p>\n<p></p></blockquote>"

>>>		<p>The arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, while offering certain clinical advantages, demands higher resource utilization compared to the traditional open Latarjet approach. This increased demand is primarily due to the need for advanced surgical tools, such as specialized arthroscopic equipment and implants, which contribute to longer operative times. The complexity of the arthroscopic technique requires surgeons to be proficient in arthroscopic skills, which can extend the learning curve and necessitate additional resources for training and equipment acquisition. These factors collectively lead to higher initial costs for healthcare systems, as they must invest in both the technology and the training required to perform the procedure effectively <reference refid="3197"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>When comparing the arthroscopic Latarjet to open procedures, the differences in resource requirements become more pronounced. The open Latarjet is generally considered less resource-intensive, as it does not require the same level of specialized equipment or training. This can result in shorter operative times and reduced costs associated with surgical tools. However, the arthroscopic approach may offer benefits in terms of reduced postoperative recovery times and potentially lower complication rates, which could offset some of the initial cost differences over the long term <reference refid="2461"></reference>. Despite these potential benefits, the upfront costs associated with the arthroscopic procedure remain a notable consideration for healthcare providers. The study by Cozzolino et al. (2024) highlights that while hardware-related complications are more frequent with screw fixation, the use of flexible fixation methods can reduce these issues, potentially impacting overall cost-effectiveness <reference refid="4372"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>The economic impact on patients is another important aspect of the cost and resource utilization discussion. Patients undergoing the arthroscopic Latarjet may face higher out-of-pocket expenses due to the increased costs associated with the procedure. These costs can include higher surgical fees and potentially longer rehabilitation periods if complications arise. However, the potential for improved outcomes and quicker return to normal activities may justify these expenses for some patients. Healthcare providers must weigh these factors when recommending surgical options, considering both the short-term financial implications and the long-term benefits for patient health and recovery <reference refid="8450"></reference>.</p>
>>>		<p>For healthcare systems, the decision to adopt the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure involves balancing the higher initial costs with the potential for improved patient outcomes and reduced long-term healthcare utilization. This requires a comprehensive evaluation of the procedure's cost-effectiveness, taking into account factors such as complication rates, reoperation rates, and patient satisfaction. As the procedure becomes more widespread, it is crucial for healthcare providers to consider these economic implications and to develop strategies that optimize resource allocation while maintaining high standards of patient care. The study by Alkaduhimi et al. (2022) suggests that establishing a national registry could help in capturing comprehensive data on surgical procedures and complications, thereby aiding in more accurate cost assessments and improving healthcare delivery <reference refid="4684"></reference>.</p>
